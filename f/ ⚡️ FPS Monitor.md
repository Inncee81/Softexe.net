FPS Monitor, contrary to what the name suggests, is used not only to display the number of frames per second.

Steam, Origin, as well as other programs offered by the largest digital games stores, offer access to applications that allow you to display the number of FPSs in a given title. That is why FPS Monitor offers something more than the iconic Fraps, thanks to which we could find out how smoothly the running production works. This tool, along with the number of frames per second, also presents detailed information about the work of the CPU, GPU, RAM, network connection and more.
 
 FPS Monitor allows you to define many user profiles, so after starting the application, you can choose one of the available settings (or create your own) to see the information you need on the screen. Interestingly, if, for example, the temperature of the selected system exceeds the indicated level, FPS Monitor will immediately inform us of this fact, if we set an appropriate alarm.
 
 It is worth noting that FPS Monitor also contains other features useful to players, such as the ability to create screenshots and save screenshots in the indicated place on the computer's hard drive.
