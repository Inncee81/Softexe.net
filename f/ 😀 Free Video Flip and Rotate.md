Like the other programs of this manufacturer, this application has also been simplified to the maximum and only performs the activities for which it was created. It allows the image to be rotated by 90 or 180 degrees clockwise or counter-clockwise as well as mirroring after the video has been loaded. The tool is targeted mainly at amateurs, and the majority of operations within the program made by a few mouse clicks.
 
 Free Video Flip and Rotate allows you to convert the edited video to AVI, GIF, MKV and MP4 formats in the selected quality.
