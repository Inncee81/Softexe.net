```sh
Flickr Tab is an extension to Google Chrome, which, together with the opening of a new tab in the browser, presents in it each time a different, interesting photo from the Flickr website. Although this is not the rule, in practice we will see, above all, photos of landscapes and animals.

After installation, the add-on does not require any configuration from the user. Just start using and after opening a new tab in your browser, enjoy the view of the new photo. The program decides the order of the photos and remembers the ones we have seen before, which should not be repeated and it is easier to find them on the list at the bottom of the screen.
 
 People who are interested in the creator of a given photo have the opportunity to directly transfer to their profile on Flickr to view his other works.
