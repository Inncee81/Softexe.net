The application allows you to add various objects, including text frames, images, links to websites or to-do lists. Freeter also allows you to place a directory tree, so you can quickly locate the necessary files without having to run Windows Explorer.
 
 All this means that in one place we can collect documents, programs, multimedia or any other files needed while working on a given project. In this way, you can save a lot of time regardless of whether we are a graphic designer, writer, photographer, IT administrator or an online store employee.
 
 The described tool includes a built-in time management manager, which allows you to determine how long we will be dealing with a given task, and how many minutes to devote to a break. When this happens, Freeter will inform us about this predefined sound signal.
 
 Freeter offers the opportunity to create multiple projects and to freely switch between them. If necessary, there is an option to duplicate projects and import them from files saved in PNG format.
