With its help, we can recover lost data, such as contacts (including names, phone numbers, e-mail addresses and more), as well as mistakenly deleted SMS messages, attachments from an MMS message, photographs and videos, all documents, and even call lists. The program allows in theory for the recovery of all important data that we could lose as a result of a mistake, equipment failure or device damage, or a memory card.
 
 FonePaw Android Data Recovery supports all phones with Android system starting from version 2.1 to the latest, including devices from such brands as Sony, LG, Samsung, HTC, Motorola and others. The process of data recovery itself is quite simple and boils down to connecting the device, and then selecting the type of files that we want to recover, after which the selection will only start scanning.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days. In addition, the function of restoring the found data is disabled in this version.
