The program allows you to create screenshots of the entire screen, the active window or a selected area, which the user selects using the mouse. In the Floomby configuration options, you can define keyboard shortcuts, so you do not have to call applications from the system tray each time.
 
 Interestingly, after taking a screenshot in Floomby it will be opened in the web browser. Thanks to this we will be able to provide a link to the page with our screenshot to another user, e.g. via e-mail or instant messenger.
