Firefox ESR (Extended Support Release) - version of the popular Mozilla Firefox browser with an extended support period.

The new Firefox policy “updates as often as possible, release once a month” has begun to cause users to experience problems with the browser: newer glitches, incompatibility of necessary add-ons, etc. For this, Firefox ESR was launched, which differs from the standard version in three important points:


A fresh release is made from the current branch only after a certain period of "testing" a regular release by all those who use non-ESR releases.
The release period is much longer than usual.
Only updates covering security holes are released for it.


Thus, at the exit we have a stable browser, with a periodicity of the release change of approximately a year, which has undergone extensive testing and has security updates.

In this form, the browser will be useful in large organizations such as universities and schools, government organizations and large private companies. During the extended loop, new components will not be added to the Firefox ESR, only fixes security and stability issues.

The main features of Firefox ESR are almost the same as the main browser version:


Convenient bookmarks bar.
Integrated search bar. The number of search engines can be increased by installing the necessary plugins.
Ability to view and work with multiple sites simultaneously in separate tabs of a single browser window.
Automatic update, the size of which is usually no more than a few hundred kilobytes.
Privacy protection.
Safe Internet browsing: privacy, protection against viruses, spyware and pop-ups, instant identification of websites and blocking access to the sites of network swindlers, dangerous transactions and fakes.
Full scaling.
RSS technology support. The ability to create bookmarks.
Huge selection of extensions and plug-ins.
