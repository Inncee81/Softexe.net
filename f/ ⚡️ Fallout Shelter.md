Fallout Shelter is a game set in the world of the popular Fallout RPG series, transferred to the PC directly from mobile devices. It allows you to create and develop your own shelter, which brings it closer to the genre of simple economic games.

The atmosphere of the series introduces us to a properly prepared menu. We start the adventure with the game by naming your crypt by giving it a number. Fallout Shelter allows you to have several crypts, each as a separate game. Traditionally, at the beginning we also have a short guide explaining the basic assumptions and dependencies.
 
 The core of the game is the appropriate expansion of the crypt by selected segments, matching people to work and controlling the coefficients of energy, food and water. They translate into general satisfaction of the residents of the crypt. Over time, with appropriate work, we will get additional funds for which we can make improvements and expand our crypt.
 
 The game allows you to conveniently switch between the general view, in which we see the whole of our crypt, and its individual rooms. The special menu helps to track all residents and their roles. Residents have their own statistics and can also be promoted.
 
 Micropayments are a big problem in this type of games. Fallout Shelter tries to approach the problem rationally. Although the game allows you to buy an additional currency, it should not create an artificial wall just to force us to do it. In addition, it offers only one currency, which is not a standard in economic games.
 
 Fallout Shelter is a perfect offer for every Fallout fan. Although it is not an RPG, it allows you to return to the destroyed world as a constructor and commander of a new shelter. The game is free, it does not contain advertisements, and micropayments do not make fun for us.
