One of the biggest advantages of the application is a transparent and created with great care graphic interface. Despite the many features available, its operation is very simple and individual tools are easy to find. The Focusky window is divided into 3 sections, the largest of which is intended for displaying a slide preview. The rest are responsible for displaying the list of all slides and access to the offered functions.
 
 Another undoubted advantage of the program is a large number of very effective slide templates, with the use of which we will create an interesting slide show in a short time and the ability to create complex animations (including enlargements, etc.). In addition, among the Focusky functions we will find those that allow us to put in our design any shapes, arrows, text, graphics, video materials, hyperlinks, Flash animations, etc.
