FCEUX is an NES emulator, or Nintendo Entertainment System console. It offers many functions and settings, thanks to which it is possible to match the quality of the game to your own needs. You can also deliberately adjust the effects to the capabilities of the hardware from the years of splendor of the console. It is very easy to use, so that every Super Mario fan will be able to spend some moments with his favorite childhood games.

Application support can be limited only to loading the ROM file with the game (you have to take care of it yourself) and start playing. However, more inquisitive users will be able to take advantage of many options that will allow you to adjust control, graphics, sound, hardware acceleration and other parameters.
 
 An interesting fact is the built-in tools not directly related to the game, but the overall pleasure of the program, such as the option of taking screenshots, to later share them with friends.
 
 Attention!
 After unpacking the archive file, the program does not require installation.
