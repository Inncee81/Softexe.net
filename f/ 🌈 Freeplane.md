The program will certainly be useful for people who are preparing for an important test or exam, but not only - creating various schemes will be helpful also when we have to provide a lot of information in a clear graphic form. The clear user interface makes the use of the application quick and easy, and if necessary, we can run multiple maps in one window (on the cards), which will definitely make our work easier.
 
 Freeplane has many useful functions, thanks to which we will create exactly the map of thoughts that we need and - if necessary - we will provide it with a password. Using the built-in editor, you can create your own graphic style, change the color and font of individual nodes, type borders, add various tags and icons, tables and even numbered lists and edit the branch's appearance to, for example, highlight important information. Nothing prevents you from including links to a website or other source. Using the tool is possible in both the window and full screen.
 
 It is worth mentioning that Freeplane offers the possibility to export created documents to popular formats. We can save mind maps as a Java applet, Flash animation, HML document, Twiki project or - just - move it to a graphic file format (JPEG or PNG), a PDF document or a text file.
 
 Attention!
 The program requires installed Java Runtime Enviroment libraries in version 1.5 or higher. The latest version of Java Runtime Enviroment can be downloaded in the PROGRAMS section -&gt; Extras -&gt; Libraries and other add-ons (see: Related Programs).
