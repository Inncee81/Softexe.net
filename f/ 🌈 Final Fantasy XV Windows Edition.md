In addition to the main campaign, Final Fantasy XV Windows Edition also features fictional extras: Episode Gladiolus, Episode Prompto and Episode Ignis. During the game, we control the figure of the young prince, Noctis Lucis Caelum. In the absence of the main character, his native city was almost completely destroyed by hostile Niflheim units. To deal with the problem, the prince will use the help of his adviser, bodyguard and childhood friend. Together, they will explore the world, fight opponents and gain better and better elements of equipment and abilities.
