The application is easy to use and most importantly it reads audio files from the discs and then saves to one of the selected digital formats - WMA, MP3, OGG, WAV or VOBIS. It also supports the modern FLAC format, which plays music in lossless audio compression. Adjusts the volume and sound quality during conversion and allows you to rip more tracks to one audio file. 
 
 
 The program not only extracts audio tracks from CDs, but also converts music to the format we choose, and with the help of the tag editor, it modifies the metadata and adds information to the music file that we quickly download from online databases (Freedb.org, etc.). Supports ID3 v1 and ID3 v2 and has a built-in playlist generator (in PLS, HTML, CSV, M3U format).
 
 
 The program interface is simple and clear. There was no support for Polish language and detailed information about each piece of music (song name, album title, year of production, content type, artist and producer, as well as property rights or commentary). In addition, FreeRIP allows you to play selected music, search for online stores and integrate with the social network Facebook.
