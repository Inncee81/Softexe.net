To add more towns to follow, use the search engine at the top of the window. It advises on a regular basis places matching the phrase entered so far, although it must be admitted that it is not fast enough to be helpful - it will be faster to enter the whole name manually. After adding to the list, the preview screen will be divided into a larger number of rectangles, each of which corresponds to the given time.
 
 It is worth adding that in the program we also have the option of creating events and then exporting them to various other websites, e.g. Gmail or Outlook.
