This time the Horizon Festival takes place in Australia, where left-hand traffic is in force. In the open world, not only beautiful landscapes await us, but also numerous challenges. Overcoming next rivals in competitions and one-on-one duels, as well as collecting collectibles (eg rebate tables) brings the player closer to the goal of winning the Horizon Festival.
 
 Forza Horizon 3 contains over 350 faithfully reproduced cars that we will purchase for the currency earned in the game. Each car can be freely modified to prepare for driving on asphalt, tropical forests, stony gorges, deserts and beaches. Known from previous parts, the ForzaVista system allows you to enjoy cars not only from the outside - you can get into selected cars by watching the dashboard, seats and other elements.
 
 Forza Horizon 3 includes a mode of network cooperation for four players who can go through all competitions in a campaign that provides tens of hours of gameplay. Next adventures await fans of the network game.
