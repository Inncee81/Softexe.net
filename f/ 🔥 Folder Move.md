> The Move folder is a small program that makes it easy to move files of installed applications to other folders or even partitions without having to reinstall them. The application moves the entire directory structure to a new location and automatically creates appropriate symbolic links, so that the selected program or game will continue to work without any problems.

The service comes down to the user indicating the folder with the program to be moved and then the destination. You can also decide whether to create a symbolic link, so that it is not visible in the file explorer.
 
 All you need to do is confirm your changes so that file transfers begin. Depending on the size of the program being transferred and the performance of hard drives, this operation can take from a few seconds, probably up to several minutes.
 
 attention
 To use the program it is necessary to run it with administrator rights.
