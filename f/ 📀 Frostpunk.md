What's going on in the Frostpunk game?
 
 We get to the post-apocalyptic world, whose inhabitants are struggling with unfavorable weather conditions. The biggest enemy of people, which we will be able to command in the story campaign and additional game modes, is the frost, because the action takes place in areas covered with ice. It is there that we will try to build a city for their wards.
 
 Moral choices
 
 Frostpunk requires making difficult decisions at various stages of the game. We make our own choices, putting in our opinion the most useful buildings, but we also need to properly manage our resources. Importantly, it is impossible to satisfy the basic needs of all residents here, so it is not uncommon to decide who to feed and who will have to say goodbye to our camp.
 
 Game modes
 
 Frostpunk contains primarily a story mode, but there is also a variant of the game in which the game is infinite. With the appearance of this fun option, the authors also released new maps, modes and solutions in the fun mechanics.
 
 Much of the campaign in the game Frostpunk is, of course, taking place in our city, but there is no shortage of fragments during which we explore the outside world. This is one of the solutions thanks to which we can learn more about the next plot events and the situation that prevails in the virtual world.
