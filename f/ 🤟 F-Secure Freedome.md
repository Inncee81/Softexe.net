The main function of the program is to hide the real IP number while using the global network resources, which allows you to hide our activity from all kinds of tracking components, advertisers or even an internet provider. With its help, we can easily define your virtual location, which in turn will allow you to access materials blocked in your region.
 
 F-Secure Freedome blocks unwanted tracking functions and all kinds of malicious websites. It also allows you to protect your computer when using public Wi-Fi networks and prevents access to private and confidential user data.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 5 days.
