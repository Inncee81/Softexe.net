The program is compatible with any application that supports a proxy server, so it can easily handle Internet browsers such as Internet Explorer, Opera, Chrome, Firefox and Safari. It can debug traffic performed in various operating systems (including the most popular ones, such as Windows, Linux or Mac) and to many different programs (eg Microsoft Office).
 
 If the user has multiple devices connected via Wi-Fi, he can use the Fiddler program to send data related to network traffic from them. We're talking about smartphones and tablets based on Android, iOS, Windows Phone and Windows RT operating systems.
 
 In the case of interception of information about activities performed in the network, Fiddler allows you to display information primarily about the status of a given session, header, cache, cookies, links, protocol, type of compression and redirections. Nothing prevents you from filtering the acquired data, conducting a thorough analysis of it, and even archiving it for later retrieval.
 
 It is worth noting that Fiddler allows performance tests, so that the user can obtain information about the "weight" of a given website, and also use the "flagging" option. bottlenecks responsible for stoppages in data transmission.
 
 Fiddler has many different personalization options that allow you to create rules using Java Script and introduce new functions to the program. The more demanding recipients will be sure to hear that the described tool can be expanded by installing various add-ons.
