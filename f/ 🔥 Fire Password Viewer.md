The program allows you to recover the username and password that we gave when logging in to any website, social service or discussion forum. It can decrypt and read login data from all user profiles available on the computer, as well as recover passwords from the browser, even if it has been secured with the master password. Firefox Password Viewer perfectly handles the reading of passwords on the local system as well as the remote one, automatically detecting the location of the profile based on the version of Firefox used.
 
 The tool can restore all the passwords given by the user when logging in to the Web using the Firefox browser from version 1.0 to the latest. The recovered information can be saved to the disk in the form of a text file, HTML, CSV or XML.
 
 Attention!
 
 Due to the functionality offered by the tool, it can be detected by antivirus software as potentially harmful and threatening our security, but it is in fact completely safe.
 The program installation wizard offers you the option of installing additional components, but you can omit this operation by clicking on the 'Decline' option.
