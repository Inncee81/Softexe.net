Although the management of machines is relatively demanding (it is not a 100% simulator), the developers of Forza Motorsport 7 also thought about less experienced players. We find here many levels of difficulty to choose from, so we can adapt the whole to your skills (it is even possible to turn on the option of automatic braking in corners!). Our rivals will not be drivers controlled by the AI, but the ghosts of other players, because the authors again use the proprietary Drivatar solution.
 
 Selected cars available in Forza Motorsport 7 can be viewed in ForzaVista mode, thanks to which we will admire not only the body, but also the interior of the machine. It is worth to use this function, because the game offers HDR technology support, works in a maximum of 4K (appropriate TV or monitor required) with 30 frames per second.
 
 Forza Motorsport 7 includes a single player mode with races, which will take up to several dozen hours to complete and also allow for single competitions. Also not forgotten about the multiplayer (divided screen and internet).
 
 Attention!
 
 The Demo Forza Motorsport 7 game contains three races. We can check the 2018 Porsche 911 GT2 RS in Dubai, test the 2015 Mercedes-Benz truck on the Mugello track and the Nissan GT-R from 2015, racing at the NÃ¼rburgring GP.
