The program is characterized by simple operation and high speed of operation. He successfully manages the processing of individual multimedia as well as entire sets of them. Despite the somewhat misleading name, the tool allows you to convert audio to M4A, M4R, ACC, WAV, WMA, OGG, FLAC, APE formats and MP3 already mentioned in various qualities, as well as to generate M3U playlists.
 
 In addition, Free Video to MP3 Converter has options for manipulating the name of the output audio file (adding suffixes and prefixes), managing tags and automatically shutting down the computer after the program has finished.
 
 Attention!
 
 The installation wizard offers the user to install additional components in the system. They are not required for the correct operation of the program and we do not recommend installing them.
