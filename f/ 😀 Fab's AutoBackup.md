This program significantly simplifies the process of migration from computer to computer or the need to save data when reinstalling or refreshing Windows. With its help, we can save not only files and user folders located on the desktop, in documents and libraries, but also to copy bookmarks, cookies and passwords from web browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Internet Explorer), e-mail (Outlook, Outlook Express, Live Mail, Thunderbird) or the Picasa database, Windows calendar events, sticky notes and more.
 
 Fab's AutoBackup even lets you transfer settings such as user wallpaper or your screen saver preferences. At startup, the program automatically scans the computer for data, and we can uncheck unnecessary elements or indicate additional files and folders to be saved. Thanks to the simplicity in the presentation of all options, the operation of the program is really simple, as well as the restoration process, where you just need to indicate the place of saving the previous copy and choose the items to be restored.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version of the program has some limitations in the number of files saved, some options may also be unavailable.
 The Polish language version has problems with Polish diacritics.
