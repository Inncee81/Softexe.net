> A simple and convenient documentation viewer in AutoCAD Drawing (DWG, DXF), DWF Drawing (DWF), Enhanced Windows Metafile (EMF) and in the proprietary Content Sealed Format (CSF) format.

The advantage of the CSF format is the security of document exchange, ie the impossibility of introducing unauthorized changes to the PDF. The browser has been equipped with basic options such as scaling, calibration, change of units, comments, etc. Unfortunately, the Free DWG Viewer has no printing function.
