> Filebot is a Chinese tool that allows you to control the mess of different versions of multimedia files, changing them according to data from websites such as IMDB, etc. It can automatically download subtitles for videos from the OpenSubtitles website, and verify their correctness (by SFV, MD5 and SHA1 ) - and not only.

Thanks to the built-in scripting engine, the tool ensures integration with popular BitTorrent clients (Î¼Torrent on Windows, Deluge on Linux and Transmission on OS X) and enables automation of many other activities. The author has launched a repository of such scripts (written in Groovy) on GitHub.
 
 The main drawback of Filebot is the inability to integrate it with external media servers - but this is a problem inherent in Java itself, in which the tool was written. However, for people who hold their media resources locally, this tool has virtually no defects (maybe it could have a nicer user interface, but on the other hand, it is well-thought-out and does not interfere with work).
 
 A great plus of the application is also the fact that the author has prepared a video guide showing how to use Filebot efficiently.
 
 Attention!
 
 The program requires Java SE Runtime Enviroment libraries installed in version 7 or newer. The latest version of Java 2 Runtime Enviroment can be downloaded in the PROGRAMS section -&gt; Extras -&gt; Libraries and other add-ons (see: Related Programs).
