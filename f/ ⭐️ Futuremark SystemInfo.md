Without the latest version of Futuremark SystemInfo it is impossible to obtain the correct results of tests carried out using 3DMark or PCMark. This tool - although it does not collect user data - sends to these applications a set of detailed information about the components installed in the computer and the drivers.
 
 Futuremark SystemInfo saves all information to a file in XML format, which is displayed after the acquisition operation.
