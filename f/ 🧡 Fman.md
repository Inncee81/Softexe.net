Fman is a two-panel file manager for advanced users. To use it, you need to know the keyboard shortcuts from the list. Most are the same as in Total Commander.

Fman is a very economical program. There are not many advanced features like handling network drives or thumbnail previews, but you can add missing features as extensions. In the basic version, however, the program allows you to view files and perform operations on them only using keyboard shortcuts or the mouse. Arrows are used for navigation, or you can press Control + P to enter the path manually. 
 
 
 You can set your own shortcuts in the file Plugins/​User/​Key Bindings.json, just like colors and fonts. Details can be learned through documentation .
 
 
 Fman can be expanded with plugs. A few ready are already on the project website , there are also instructions for writing your own plugins. Download the downloaded plug-in scripts in the program folder.
