Using Firefox and entering various data, such as eg username, the mentioned browser uses autocompletion functions, remembering the e-mail address or user search history in the internal database file. Thanks to this, he may be able to use certain websites more quickly in the future, as he does not have to re-enter the entire login in order to log in to the e-mail account. This has, of course, pros and cons, so if we do not want to store valuable information, we can delete it using the Firefox Autocomplete Spy app.
 
 Firefox Autocomplete Spy displays detailed information about user data in the form of a clear table divided into columns (we can delete them one by one or all with a single click), which can be sorted to help you find the details you need. 
 
 Interestingly, it is also possible to view another user's data on the same computer or using remote PC access. In addition, Firefox Autocomplete Spy allows you to save the list of autocompletions to files in HTML, XML, CSV and TXT formats.
