FreeCAD is a free and open program for parametric design of three-dimensional objects - this means that you can go back to any of the process steps and change its parameters at any time. The program is addressed to engineers and mechanics, but it is also well suited for the design of utility objects and architectural details.

FreeCAD contains tools similar to those found in Catania, SolidWorks or SolidEdge, which qualifies for MCAD, PLM, CAx and CAE categories. Like other three-dimensional design programs, FreeCAD also includes tools for creating technical drawings and sketching shapes, but drawing is not its main purpose. Its modular structure allows you to implement new capabilities without interfering with the "core", thanks to which it develops very promising. Its possibilities can be expanded by scripts written in Python.
 
 
 The program has been equipped with several work spaces, designed to work with various types of models. Immediately after the installation of the program, you can proceed to the design of parts, work with nets, tracking robot movements, as well as ship design, including the option of calculating displacement. Beginners will be happy with the "First Steps" link, which contains tutorials and explanations of the next elements of the program. 
 
 
 The program is created under the LGPL license and is created exclusively by enthusiasts and volunteers in their free time. It is based on the OpenCascade kernel and the Coind3D project , which is one of the incarnations of Open Onventor. It currently works without any problems on Windows, OS X and various Linux distributions.
