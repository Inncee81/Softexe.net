When it comes to fundamental assumptions in game mechanics, Farming Simulator 17 offers what fans of previous hits of the cycle know. Once again, we play the role of the owner of the farm, and our task is to develop our company. We must therefore grow animals (including cows, pigs, sheep, chickens) and grow plants (eg sunflowers), and then transport the crops and sell them in order to earn money.
 
 Farming Simulator 17 does not turn the rules upside down, but includes previously inaccessible locations (the action takes place in the open world of North America), new vehicles, new animals, new plants and many, many more. In total, over 250 agricultural machines manufactured by well-known brands (eg Challenger, Fendt, Valtra and Massey Ferguson) were available.
 
 It is worth noting that there is also network multiplayer available in Farming Simulator 17. We can work with up to fifteen other people and manage your own farm together. Noteworthy is also the fact that the game has support for mods, or fan additions.
