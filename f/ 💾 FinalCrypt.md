Using the program is extremely simple. The whole thing is a bit like file managers, but it's just a semblance. In the left part of the main FinalCrypt window, select the files that you want to encrypt or decrypt, and in the right you must place the encryption file. Only after preparing the tool, you can press the "encrypt" button to start the data security operation.
 
 FinalCrypt also includes an additional tab with an event log, where information about the operations being performed is presented.
