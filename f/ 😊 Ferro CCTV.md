In combination with cameras (USB or connected via TV and video cards), it enables the creation of a fully professional monitoring system. It is an ideal solution for stores, gas stations, warehouses, as well as private properties. Ferro CCTV can record a video image at a rate of 1 to 25 frames / second, which can be used to record static and moving objects. The program can use popular DivX codecs, which in combination with motion detection and time-lapse recording, gives you the ability to store many months of recordings on your computer. The program also allows you to record sound.Ferro CCTV eliminates the inconvenience that can be encountered when using a traditional time-lapse video recorder (high price, frequent cassette change, long access time to recorded sessions). The Zoom function, unseen in traditional CCTV systems, allows you to closely view selected parts of the image. The monitoring system based on Ferro CCTV, due to low costs, easy operation and automatic recording options, can be used even in small companies.
 
 The program consists of two modules: Ferro CCTV Recorder - enabling the recording of images from any type of camera and recording of video material on the computer disk and Ferro CCTV Player - used to view the recorded events.
 
 MAIN FEATURES AND BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM
 
 Ferro CCTV - Recorder
 Ferro CCTV - The recorder allows you to view the image from the camera on the monitor screen and record video on the computer disc. The camera view can be displayed "in a window" or "full screen". The program requires that a USB camera, TV card or other capture device be installed in the computer. A camera is connected to such a device that allows monitoring of the selected room or open area.
 
 The program saves color video in AVI format, which can be played both by the program Ferro CCTV - Player as well as any other program that plays multimedia files, such as Windows Media Player. The saved stream can be compressed "on the fly" using the codecs available in the system, eg: DivX, MPEG-4 ... which will take up significantly less disk space. The program can set the recording speed in the range of 0.1 frames / sec. up to 30 frames / sec and dimensions of the material being recorded.
 
 There are options in the program that allow you to use the program without a service. Selecting the option "Run at system startup" will automatically start the program after power failure or computer restart. In conjunction with the option "Enable recording after starting the program", the CCTV system does not require any start-up actions when switching on the computer - recording will start automatically.
 
 By setting the recording speed to 1 fps, image dimensions 320x240 (VHS quality) and DivX compression, the program will store several months of storage on a 20 GB disk. This time can be even longer if the Motion Detection option is enabled. In this case, the recording is made only when the object moves in the camera frame.
 
 Ferro CCTV - Player
 
 Ferro CCTV - The player is used to play previously recorded material. In addition to the typical features, such as watching "in the window" and "full screen", the program has a unique feature of smoothly zooming in on the image (Zoom), which allows you to look more closely at selected areas of the plan.
 
 Another function that allows you to view the recorded material accurately is "Playback speed". Thanks to it you can quickly view the hours of recordings at a speed setting of 16x or, at a speed setting of less than 1x, view carefully selected sequences.
 
 Finding the right part of the recording is very simple because the names of all recorded files have the form: year _ month _ day_cctv _ hour _ minute _ second. It is enough in the Ferro CCTV program - Player to choose the file we want, and then scroll the material to the place you want to view.
 
 An additional feature is the function that allows you to automatically find a recording from a given period. Just enter the date and time and the program will search for the correct file on the disk, load it and scroll to the right place with an accuracy of one second.
