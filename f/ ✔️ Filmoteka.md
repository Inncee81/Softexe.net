The program searches for detailed information about video and audio codecs, adds information about the file size, duration of the video and its resolution to the database. The Filmoteka offers two modes of operation: searching our disk resources, the option - "Search movies" and browsing CDs, through the option - "Autodczyt CD". The database can be exported to TXT or XLS files. It is also possible to import a database from Excel (in txt format).
 
 Additional advantage of Film Library is the possibility of cooperation with several Polish film websites.
