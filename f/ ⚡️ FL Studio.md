The program has been created continuously for over 12 years, and its great potential has been appreciated by many popular artists from both Poland and the world. Their first steps with music put in FL Studio such fame as even Basshunter. There are many uses of the program, starting from creating complete songs, creating foundations, combining them with the vocals, and ending with "refining" and mixing ready-made projects. Despite the enormous possibility, contrary to appearances, the tool is easy to use, perfectly suited to amateur and fully professional multi-channel music creation. In the first case, ready-made templates come in handy, significantly facilitating work with the program.
 
 Working with FL Studio is based around a refined sequencer that supports, among others, MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) system. After creating a new project, we can start creating multi-channel melodic lines, foundations, recording via a voice microphone, applying ready-made samples, effects, etc. A great advantage of the program are the many possibilities of configuring, among others tempo, duration of individual sounds, pitch and much, much more. FL Studio can work as an independent tool, VSTi plugin, DXi plugin or ReWire client, while offering support for ASIO and DirectSound controllers. Another advantage of the program is its open architecture, giving the possibility of any extension of its functionality. 
 
 The demo version available for free offers full functionality and most plugins (instruments and effects), available in the full version, without time limits. Finished projects can be saved to WAV, MIDI, MP3 and OGG files. The only limitation is the inability to save the project as such, for example for later processing, mixing, etc.
