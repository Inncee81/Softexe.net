The tool is simple to use. Flash Video Downloader automatically generates content that we can download to your computer's hard drive by presenting it in the form of a clear list. Just click on the arrow located next to the address bar (on the right) to check which movies are available for download from a given website, and then use the "download" button located next to the file name.
 
 Flash Video Downloader supports the most popular file formats, such as: MP4, 3GP, FLV, MOV, AVI, WMV, ASF, SWF and WEBM. Unfortunately, the program can not deal with downloading movies shared via YouTube, but you can use it while browsing Facebook, Dailymotion and Vimeo.
