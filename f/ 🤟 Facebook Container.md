> Facebook Container is an official Mozilla add-on for Mozilla, which launches the title social network site, Messenger and Instagram in an isolated environment (container) to prevent other websites from accessing the information they collect.

Thanks to this, the security and privacy of the user are additionally protected. Facebook is trying to link information about the user in normal conditions with additional data from other websites that he browses, as long as they offer, for example, the ability to log in or comment on publications using Facebook data. With the use of the described additive, such activities will no longer be possible.
 
 This extension does not require any configuration. After installation, the user normally visits the Facebook page, and Firefox automatically isolates all activity from the rest. The natural consequence of using this type of security, however, is the separation of the possibility of using Facebook data on other websites. So if we used them so far to log in elsewhere, now this functionality will stop working properly.
