Using the described tool, we do not need to browse resources such as YouTube in search of a favorite song - this task is simplified by the search engine built into the Free Music Downloader. It supports many websites offering access to music videos and music. It depends on the user whether the program will search all or only selected resources. Using the application, it is possible to download video clips and save them to a disc in the MP4 format or to "pull" from an audio track to MP3 files. In addition, the tool has the function of downloading album covers.
