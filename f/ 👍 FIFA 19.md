A lot of new products can be found in the fun options, because FIFA 19 adds new variants in a quick match that we can play on our own terms. We will decide ourselves whether all goals will be scored or only those shot with head or volley; we can also set a rule that goals from behind the penalty area count twice. In addition, FIFA 19 includes an interesting survival mode in which after scoring one player from our team must leave the pitch.
 
 FIFA 19 also offers new features during the game. The player can set the defenders for the area to cover, and also instruct the players to press on the players of the opposing team. There is also a new option when shooting. Double clicking the shot button (at the right pace) will increase the chance of placing the ball in the net.
 
 For the purposes of FIFA 19, new issues of commentators were also recorded, including the European cup competitions. During the game, we will again hear Dariusz Szpakowski and Jacek Laskowski, who performed in previous games from the FIFA series.
 
 The demo version of FIFA 19 includes the following teams: Juventus, Real Madrid, Manchester United, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain, Atletico Madrid, Borussia Dortmund, AS Roma and Tottenham Hotspur.
 
 In the FIFA 19 demo, players can play matches with the aforementioned teams (also in the Champions League), as well as check what the new chapter of the story in Road to Fame mode will have, which main character is Alex Hunter. Fictitious footballer known from FIFA 18 and FIFA 17 this time he moved to Real Madrid.
