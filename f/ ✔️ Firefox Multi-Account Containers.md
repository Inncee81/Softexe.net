> Firefox Multi-Account Containers is the official extension to Firefox, which allows you to use isolated containers for the simultaneous use of multiple accounts on the same sites, simultaneously within a single browser window.

An additional advantage is the ability to conveniently divide sites into different containers, where each one is assigned different colors, icons and descriptions, which will visually separate related pages, for example, from learning from professional ones.
 
 The containers first appeared in one of the test releases of the browser, and then tested as part of the Test Pilot project.
 
 Attention!
 The extension is designed to be used also in the stable version of Firefox 57, but until then, those willing to install the 57th Nightly version should use the special installer provided by the creators on Github .
