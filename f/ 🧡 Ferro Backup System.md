Ferro Backup System is a network application designed to create data backup and archiving, which works on the basis of client / server architecture. It allows you to back up servers, workstations and portable computers running under Windows, Linux and macOS.

The program through the central management module allows easy and automatic backup for multiple computers simultaneously. Due to the use of differential backup and compression on the workstation side, it enables the archiving of data from all computers in the local network in a short time.
 
 Ferro Backup System does not require any tape drives to operate (although it supports them in Professional and Enterprise versions) - it uses many times cheaper and more capacious hard drives for this purpose. This gives, in combination with low system and hardware requirements, as well as an attractive price of the program, very low implementation and handling costs with equally high reliability. Ferro Backup System operates in the client / server architecture and allows to secure computers connected to a computer network. Backup can include individual files and directories or entire hard drives. In the event of a failure, it is possible to restore the archived data and the operating system with installed programs.
 
 The application operates on the basis of a web interface, access to which can be accessed via a web browser. This solution allows administrators to manage the backup system using a remote computer or tablet. It also gives the possibility of using the program by several administrators at once and offers three levels of access security: administrator, operator and observer.
 
 The most important functions and benefits of the program
 High performance
 
 Due to the use of differential backup, compression on the workstation side, parallel execution of tasks Ferro Backup System allows you to make copies of files from all computers connected to the local network in a very short time.
 
 Low costs
 
 Ferro Backup System does not require an expensive server, server version of the operating system or tape drives. Due to the fact that data compression takes place already on the side of workstations and not on the server, an ordinary, cheap PC with a larger hard disk can be allocated to the backup server.
 
 Resistance to failures
 
 In the event of a connection failure, the archiving tasks will be halted and completed after the connection is reestablished without the administrator's intervention.
 
 Quick implementation
 
 To use the Ferro Backup System you do not need to change anything in the current configuration of the computer network, servers and office computers. Ferro Backup System works completely independently of existing services, account configuration and security.
 
 maintenance-free
 
 The option of automatically freeing disk space in conjunction with the alert module, which sends information to the administrator about possible errors and warnings via e-mail, reduces the need for constant supervision of the program.
 
 Transparent archiving
 
 Archiving is done in the background and is not noticeable to ordinary employees of the company.
 
 Convenience
 
 The administrator does not have to worry about when the last full backup was made, and when and how many differential backups were made. Ferro Backup System takes control over the process of recovering data from differential copies and displays their contents in the same way as for full copies.
 
 Free help
 
 In the event of problems with the installation or operation of the program, you will receive free telephone technical support.
 
 The most important news from version 5
 
 In version 5.0, large changes have been introduced that affect the speed of backups. The most important is the use of symmetrical multiprocessor. Thanks to this, for example, for a quad-core computer, you can get a nearly fourfold increase in backup speed. Additionally, the optimization of the network protocol allowed to increase by 1/3 the data transmission speed to the backup server.
 
 The latest version gives the possibility of archiving and recovering computers without sending data to the backup server. This solution allows you to efficiently secure computers located in company branches connected to the exchange with a weak network connection. In addition, you can specify rules for blocking or restricting the use of a network link based on the IP address from which the connection originated. Therefore, a portable computer can be archived at full speed if it connects to a backup server over a LAN network, and if it connects to, for example, a cellular network modem, the backup can be blocked or slowed down.
 
 Another new feature is the ability to backup and restore virtual machines working under the control of the Microsoft Hyper-V host. In combination with the performance improvements introduced in this release, Microsoft Hyper-V and VMWare ESX (i) virtual machines can now be quickly secured.
 
 For administrators managing different operating systems, the Docker container support will be a great help. Containers with the Ferro Backup System allow you to easily and quickly launch a backup server or client on any operating system supporting this technology. Ferro Backup System container can be run on computers running Windows, Linux, OS X or NAS devices (Synology, QNAP) with Intel x86-64 processor.
 
 Version 5.0 works with the latest versions of Microsoft operating systems: Windows 10 and the upcoming Windows Server 2016. Supports m.in. hybrid sleep, quick start and InstantGo functions.
 
 Attention!
 
 In the unregistered version, it is possible to connect up to two workstations (archiving two computers). In addition, it can be used only for non-profit and non-commercial purposes (for demonstration, testing, teaching, research and home purposes).
