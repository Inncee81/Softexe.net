> FileFriend is a small application for splitting files into smaller fragments (and vice versa), encrypting them and saving other files inside photos in JPG format.

The interface is simple and divided into tabs responsible for each of the functions listed above. By dividing one large file into several smaller ones, the user's task will be to indicate the source file and to select the way of division: into a specific number of parts or any number of parts, but with the size limitation of each of them.
 
 The reverse option was conveniently implemented, ie the submission of several parts into one file. Here, when selecting the source elements, just select one of them in the explorer, and the application itself will recognize the others, adding them to the list of waiting parts.
 
 Saving inside a JPG file allows you to hide any "inside" pictures, to hide them from unauthorized people who do not expect this type of protection.
