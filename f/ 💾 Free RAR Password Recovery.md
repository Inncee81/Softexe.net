The free edition offers the option of recovering the password using the Brute-force technique. This Matoda, though sometimes time-consuming, is effective and is based on checking every possible combination of characters in the password. The Pro version allows you to additionally use masks and dictionaries in the recovery process. 
 
 Free RAR Password Recovery gives the user access to several useful options for refining searches. Thanks to them, we will quickly eliminate, during the recovery process, eg spaces, numbers or symbols of various types, as well as determine the minimum length of the search term, which will shorten the time of the tool.
