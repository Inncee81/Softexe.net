This time we are moving to Great Britain. Forza Horizon 4 does not introduce a revolution, but nevertheless, the authors were tempted by a significant novelty. Individual races are played at different times of the year, which has a huge impact on the behavior of the car, because we drive not only in sunny weather, but also for example in the snow. Moreover, it can not be forgotten that the action takes place also in spring and autumn.
 
 Forza Horizon 4 allows you to freely explore the open world, where numerous races to complete are waiting for us. The goal of the game is to win the title festival, but before that happens, we will prove our abilities in the next competitions, unlock faster vehicles (including more than 450 cars in total), and - if we wish - we will leave the single player mode and take part in the game network.
 
 Demo version Forza Horizon 4 allows you to familiarize yourself with the greatest attraction of this part of the series, namely to play short races in autumn, winter, spring and summer. Various cars are waiting for testing, as well as various types of competitions, including the uncomplicated plot tasks appearing in the Forza Horizon cycle for the first time.
