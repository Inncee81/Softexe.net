Tools can definitely overwhelm the number of options - in the end, we have to deal with a very extensive tool. The main window of the program is occupied by a multi-track timeline, the place where we create our works. An important element of the interface is also a special screen that allows you to quickly preview the sound.
 
 After several minutes of use, however, it turns out that the interface - despite the multitude of screens - is very transparent and requires no specialist knowledge. It allows for easy use of available tools and very easy performing various operations, such as creating basic and multi-track sounds or converting music tracks. The program also includes a sound search engine, which we can directly place on a multi-track timeline or modify it first.
 
 It should be noted that using FMOD Studio, among others, created music and sounds for many high-budget video games, such as: World of Warcraft, Guitar Hero, LA Noire and Crysis.
