In Five Nights at Freddy's 2, we're again the guardian of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, but this is not the same character we were controlling in the first installment. Our task is to monitor the cameras and guard the order, and then - as it turns out - survive the title five nights.
 
 When carrying out the duties entrusted to us, it should be borne in mind that the person previously employed in our position complained about the animatronic figures who intended to enter the office. This gentleman is now working on a daily shift, and what is happening after dark must be our protagonist.
 
 It is worth noting that animatronic characters have been equipped with a facial recognition system, but during the Five Nights at Freddy's 2 game, we can set up a special mask, thanks to which we can fool opponents trying to kill the main character.
