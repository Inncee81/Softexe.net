The tool uses a special file segmentation algorithm that allows for faster downloading of data from the Internet. FlareGet enables downloading files from websites (HTTP and HTTPS protocols) and FTP servers. Among the available options, we will also find a function of pausing and resuming downloading, which turns out to be very useful in a situation when it will be terminated due to an internet failure (this option is not available via FTP).
 
 FlareGet allows you to divide the downloaded data into various categories, segregating them even after the extension of individual files. However, all downloaded materials can be manually assigned to a given tab (eg applications, documents, video, audio, photos and others), so that you can find them in the blink of an eye if you need to.
