The browser is a bit like a system explorer, but here the addition is the ability to display a small preview thumbnail. There is also a main window, where you can browse the catalogs and their tree on the left. Of course, the photograph can be displayed much larger and then it fills the vast majority of the window. It is possible here to zoom, crop and rotate photos.
