The application, apart from the possibility of issuing various types of sales documents, also allows to create files of goods, services and clients, in which the collected information can support the user at the stage of generating each new invoice. What's more, with the help of the Invoice Small Business program, we will quickly and efficiently prepare an offer or order for the client, which in a later stage can be easily converted into a invoice or a pro-forma invoice. Finished sales documents can be printed as standard, stored on a disk in PDF, HTML, JPG format or sent to the customer by e-mail.
 
 In addition, the program gives access to various types of statements and analyzes useful in the company - ie VAT sales records, sales analysis by goods and services, sales analysis by customers, best / worst sold goods, best / worst customers, quantitative report of goods sold for a given period or a report on outstanding amounts due from customers.
 
 An additional advantage of the Small Business Invoice is the possibility to create your own order template and invoice, thanks to which the document printed by us can look exactly the way we need it. The program can be successfully used on individual workstations, as well as many computers working within the local area network (MySQL database is used to store data). Among supported fiscal printers we find devices from ELZAB, Innova and PosNet.
