The program is also great for securing any directory on your hard drive. At the time of adding selected folders to the application, they are secured and are no longer visible from the operating system. In this way, the data will not be available to other users using the same computer.
 
 
 The operation of the program is very easy. The user can easily and quickly secure, hide or block any directories or files with the password using the built-in drag-and-drop method, which streamlines and significantly accelerates the use of the application. It is also worth mentioning that Folder Lock allows securing entire partitions. This applies to both system and logical partitions. 
 
 
 When encrypting data, we create a new folder anywhere on the hard disk and secure it with an additional password. Then select the appropriate file system and size of the folder, and after a while, the program will automatically create it in the form of an additional drive visible in Windows Explorer. This catalog works on the principle of a virtual drive that protects and protects personal data with an additional encryption algorithm. 
 
 
 Folder Lock also has a tool for creating and restoring data backups in the form of Online on the manufacturer's server (free registration required). In addition, we will find in it other useful functions for copying protected data on any USB or CD / DVD media, as well as for securing private user data (credit cards, etc.).  
 Attention!
 The Folder Lock program is available in a trial version and has time limits during use. Users can test it for at least 5 days or run up to 30 times. In addition, messages prompting you to buy a full commercial version of the program are displayed.
