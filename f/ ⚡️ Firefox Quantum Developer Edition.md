The program from the standard version of the fiery fox is distinguished primarily by a dark, slightly modified interface. You can find on it buttons that allow immediate access to all development tools. Among them, there is a DOM tree inspector that allows you to edit HTML code and CSS styles, a console that allows you to learn about any programs on the website, as well as a special debugger to check the correctness of JavaScript code. The programmer can also use a dedicated CSS style editor, a network monitor and a tool to check the performance of the code by recording JavaScript function calls.
 
 The programming tools allow you to preview the responsive mode, a color sampler is also available, which allows you to know the color value of a given pixel on the screen. The browser also contains a rough copy in which you can enter JavaScript code and then test its operation. An important advantage is the Firefox WebIDE module that allows you to create entire applications, and then test them in a simulator, on an external device, Chrome Desktop or Safari for iOS. The browser can also be connected to Firefox for the Android platform, in order to test and prepare applications for this system.
 
 The Developer Edition is based on releases from the Aurora channel, so it is newer than the official stable release and contains new features that ordinary users still have to wait for. It is occupied with slightly lower stability - this edition can sometimes cause problems and people using it should be aware of it. It can be installed next to regular Firefox and does not affect its operation. In addition, it behaves like a regular version: you can browse pages, use messengers, install add-ons, and change advanced settings.
