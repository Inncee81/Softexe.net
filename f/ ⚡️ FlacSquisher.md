FlacSquisher is a very simple application that allows you to convert music saved in the lossless format of FLAC audio compression to more popular MP3 and OGG files. Thanks to it, we will save valuable space on your computer's hard drive with a slight drop in sound quality, as well as recreate your favorite music collections on smartphones and various types of portable devices (which FLAC format does not support).

The FlacSquisher tool is characterized by its small size, simple operation and high speed of audio conversion between supported formats. It can work in multithreaded mode, allowing support for various conversion parameters using Lame and Ogg Vorbis codecs. The program allows you to work with entire music libraries (no possibility of indicating individual files).
 
 From the configuration options, the user can define file extensions that will not be included in the conversion. This may be useful if the music directory that we defined in the application, apart from FLAC files, also contains music in other formats.
