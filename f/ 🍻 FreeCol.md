> FreeCol is a turn-based strategy fully based on the rules, principles and philosophy known and valued by fans of the genre, the famous production of Colonization. We start the game with one colonist, gradually raising, from 1492, the territory of the "new world". The goal of the player is not only to create a large and powerful nation, but also to provide him with favorable conditions for existence and development by pursuing appropriate social, economic, economic and military policies. The culmination of the game is the announcement of its independence while conducting victorious battles and successfully resisting the attacks of other hostile nations.
