The program gives the user the ability to block access to valuable files and folders by applying a password. A function is also offered, with the help of which we completely hide private data, and access to them will only be possible after the correct login to the tool. Other security modes in which Folder Guard is equipped include protection of, for example, system files before modification or deletion, disabling access to removable media, restricting access to the Windows Control Panel, etc. Unlike other solutions of this type Folder Guard protects data without encryption .
 
 With the help of Folder Guard, we will password-protect almost every folder stored on the disk, thus protecting private data from unauthorized users. The tool allows you to handle any number of locations, allowing you to use different passwords for them or use a master password. Using the program, we also have the ability to control access to the application. Other functions include working in stealth mode and handling keyboard shortcuts.
 
 The Guard folder supports hard drives and partitions with the FAT16, FAT32 and NTFS file systems.
 
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
