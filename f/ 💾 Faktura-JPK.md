> Faktura-JPK is a program for issuing invoices with warehouse support and JPK, created on the basis of a proven NT-based Invoice, taken from our catalog several thousand times. Compared to its original, it is devoid of support for some of the more sophisticated functions, but it does provide a wealth of features that allow you to display a wide variety of invoices and, importantly, it is available for readers of the portal free programs (details below)!

The intuitive interface makes it easy to print a VAT invoice quickly, and over 20 templates give the possibility to adjust the printout to the individual preferences of the user. The program supports dual currency sales, export invoices and WDT, receipts, advance and summary invoices, RR invoices, corrections. VAT invoices can also be quickly issued to receipts printed using the system. The contractor's details are automatically filled in after entering his NIP number.
 
 The program also provides a card catalog of goods and contractors, a database of PKWiU codes, allows you to run a warehouse including inventory control, issue WZ and PZ documents, inventory, etc., keep records of orders for suppliers and customers, allows partial fulfillment of orders, offers registers, reports, analysis, payment control, Intrastat declarations and many more.
 
 The program can generate JPK_VAT and JPK_FA files. These files can then be sent directly to the Ministry of Finance or to the accounting office.
 
 The JPK invoice is basically a paid program, costing PLN 79 gross. However, for the readers of the portal, we have a surprise program - the basic version of the program can be completely free after entering the SY18WC code , which should be provided during registration .
 
 The program without registration works for 30 days as a full version, therefore it can be tested before registration. The application in the basic version has free updates, but it is limited to one position and is not covered by technical support (which you can, however, buy). You can also purchase one expansion packet (and so much already) of the program's capabilities. You can find more information on this subject in the article .
