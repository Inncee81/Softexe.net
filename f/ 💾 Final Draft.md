The program was created mainly for writing film scripts, theater performances and television serials and other documentary programs. If you want to use Final Draft, you do not need to know the rules for creating scenarios or other text scripts. The application will automatically transform and adapt the written text or script to industry standards. It is worth noting that this software is also used by world cinema and television stars, including Tom Hanks, James Cameron and JJ Abrams.
 
 
 In Final Draft we will also find a lot of ready-made templates containing fragments of scenarios, scripts and other types of texts. In addition, it also has a special speech synthesizer for reading text and a function for searching for synonyms (synonyms). In addition, it also contains many other useful tools for printing whole novels or scenarios, saving text in PDF format, highlighting a separate text fragment with different colors, and checking spelling and spelling in different languages.
