The game was embedded in a post-apocalyptic comic world, from which 98% of the human population disappeared, however, she was dressed in a funny, comic graphic setting. Players can play in one of four classes: soldier, assault, ninja and builder. During the fight and gathering of materials there will be many opportunities to get a new weapon, from knives to firearms of a large caliber, as well as building materials and various gadgets. Speed, dexterity and ingenuity count in the game. 
 
 
 In Battle Royale mode , available for free on all platforms, 100 players in PvP mode can fight on one map. The authors of the game took care of cyclical events, rankings and weekly updates so that the game would not be boring.
