Documents can be issued in many different annual or monthly numbers. The program is created in a proven solution, developed since 1985, based on the FileMaker Pro Advanced database system. The data is stored locally on a computer in a secure database without the need to access the Internet. Faqt was created mainly for users of computers with apple, but there is also a Windows version available.
 
 At no additional cost, you can use the same invoice and document database on both Mac and Windows. The file containing the data (database) is identical for both platforms.
