The package installer allows you to specify which components to install and which are not. Importantly, the installer is also available in the Polish language version. The program allows you to substitute sounds, cursors and window themes known from Mac OS X. You can also change the dimensions of the icons. The user has the right to choose whether he would like to use the appearance of Tiger or Panther Apple system. Also here, we can still use the Start menu or access to Documents from the taskbar. It is worth noting that FlyakiteOSX works only in 32-bit editions of Windows.
 
 FlyakiteOSX in the basic version allows you to map Mac OS X Panther or Tiger in Windows. After installing the package, we can use the upgrade or uninstall FlyakiteOSX if it does not suit us. It is relatively easy, the application does not replace any system files.
