In addition to standard options, such as creating your own song library and starting, stopping or selecting more songs, Foobnix provides a number of additional functionalities. The user can listen to various radio stations from around the world, enjoy the possibility of integration with the popular last.fm streaming service and the not-so-popular Russian social network service Vkontakte.
 
 Interestingly, Foobnix allows you to download an add-on that will offer the option of converting selected files to other popular formats. It is also worth adding that the application includes the function of adding tags to your songs, as well as displaying detailed information about the song being played and searching for similar pieces.
 
 The user interface at Foobnix does not seem intuitive at first glance, so you need a long time to read it. However, if the layout of the main window does not exactly suit us, we can adjust its appearance to your own preferences (you can, for example, add a graphic background, modify the style of the menu and change the position of some elements).
