Using the Foto-Mosaik-Edda program is not complicated, because the creators have prepared a special mosaic creation wizard, so everyone will be able to prepare it - it is enough to perform simple commands appearing on the screen. It is worth noting that in addition to creating a mosaic, the tool also allows you to order a poster printout with your work.
 
 Foto-Mosaik-Edda allows you to import any digital photo (for example from a holiday or a family meeting) from a hard disk or graphic from a flickr website, which we can transform into a mosaic, that is a picture consisting of small photos that are matched to each other so that they looked like a single picture.
