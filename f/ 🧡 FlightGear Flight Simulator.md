The product was built on the basis of a realistic engine that is supposed to faithfully hand over a pilot of various air units. It started with airplanes, but helicopters and even space shuttles quickly arrived. It was connected with a beautiful terrain generator that supports vegetation, water, three-dimensional clouds and variable lighting conditions, depending on the time of day. He does not complain about the graphics.
 
 
 Because the program code is freely available, over time, multiplayer options. FlightGear is also available not only in the Windows version. The game is also the basis of many scientific studies on the behavior of individuals in the air, which only emphasizes its professionalism. Contrary to appearances, however, it is not just a suggestion for maniacs. Novices should also find something for themselves here.
 
 
 Attention!
 
 We recommend to take interest in free packages with additional content from the constantly expanding repository of this project. There await, among others new aircraft models.
