```sh
FreeRecover is very simple, and in addition, a free tool to recover files on NTFS hard drives, which we lost as a result of failure, the operation of the virus or removed completely by accident.

From the upper part of the program window, we need to indicate the partition that interests us, and then click the "search" button. FreeRecover will generate a list of data that can be recovered. To do this, select the appropriate files and use the "recover files" function. If the search results are too large, there are no obstacles to sorting them, for example, by name, path or size.
 
 FreeRecover also lets you download the original file paths. The data integrity check function was also available to the user.
