The program is very easy to use and work with it through a built-in wizard that guides you through the entire password search process. In the next steps, indicate the archive to which you lost the password, and then define the method that will be used to find it. Free RAR Password Unlocker allows you to search for a password using Brute-Force, Brute-Force with a mask and using a dictionary.
 
 A password recovery operation depending on its length can be time-consuming. To reduce the time needed to search for the correct password, the program has been equipped with options to narrow down the search. With their help, we will determine the minimum length of the password or exclude characters that we are sure that the password is not there.
