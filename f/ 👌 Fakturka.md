```sh
Faktura is not a very extensive, but very easy to use, free invoicing program.
```

In addition to invoice prints, it allows you to keep records of contractors, products and services (without inventory) and maintains a simple register of issued invoices. The biggest advantage of the Fakturka program, apart from the fact that it is free, is a printout editor that allows you to freely define the appearance of the invoice and how to calculate the invoice value (from net or gross prices).
 
 Additional advantages of invoices are: the possibility of printing a transfer / payment to the bank, correcting note, printing data on envelopes, stable work and no visible errors in contrast to other (often amateur) free programs for invoicing.
