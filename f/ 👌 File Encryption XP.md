```sh
File Encryption XP is a small program for encrypting any files in the system, using the Blowfish algorithm and passwords, which are not saved anywhere during the protection. While the application is running, no temporary files are created, and the memory allocated is quickly drained, which, combined with the lack of a "back door" to the program, guarantees a high level of security during operation.

Apart from the usual encryption and decryption of files, the application also allows for earlier data compression, creation of self-extracting archives (EXE) and irreversible deletion of selected folders from the disk. All kinds of files are supported, one of which can weigh even more than 4 GB.
 
 During the installation, the program integrates with the system shell, giving the user access to the encryption and decryption options from the context menu in the Windows file explorer. The application can also be installed on a portable memory to take advantage of its advantages at every opportunity when using a pendrive.
 
 Attention!
 The trial edition was limited to 30 days of operation.
