> Formicide is a free 2D shooter game based on the skill and dynamics of the action based on the convention of the famous Worms. Cult worms were decided to replace here with ants, and the turn-based system of the game change to the struggles in real time, which significantly affects the unpredictability and even greater attractiveness of the game.

In addition to the aforementioned innovations, eight character classes (including a sniper, hunter, engineer, soldier) have been added to give each match a diverse character. The individual characteristics and abilities of individual ants add to each other different impressions, but at the same time they require a slightly different strategy and tactics in the fight.
 
 The main concept of the game was still maintained, during several minutes of clashes we try to eliminate as many opponents as possible with the lowest possible losses. We also try to collect all possible bonuses, upgrade our class and complete further matches, gaining next experience levels.
 
 In Formicide, the game is very nice, and the title, despite its simplicity, entertains, cheers and provides a lot of fun.
 
 Attention!
 
 In order to install the game, you should download the Steam program - a special online platform that allows you not only to buy and download computer games, but also to offer players the opportunity to contact each other, exchange experiences and play together.
