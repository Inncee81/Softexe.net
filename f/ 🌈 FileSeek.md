FileSeek is an advanced utility for searching files on your computer by different criteria. Periodically, users encounter difficulties in finding any files that are lost on the PC. Manual search is very tedious, and it takes considerable time. It is better to use special programs for this, one of which is FileSeek.

This application allows you to use a variety of filters and settings to find the files that interest you. Thus, the data can be filtered by size and date of creation, and the search itself is conducted by keywords in the file name or even by text inside the file itself. It is possible to specify the path to the information, exclude files and folders by a certain mask from the search, use regular expressions, and also apply a number of other advanced functions.

Key features:


multi-threaded search mode by file name or text inside it
flexible installation of search criteria
ability to synchronize search settings between multiple computers
saving search patterns and search results
