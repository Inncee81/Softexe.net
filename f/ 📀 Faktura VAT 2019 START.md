The application has been equipped with a set of basic tools that allow to significantly improve the functioning of a small enterprise. In addition to servicing all types of sales documents, it enables cash registers and transfers, management of the list of contractors and offered products, creation of price lists, VAT registration as well as generating various sales reports, etc.
 
 The VAT invoice 2019 START gives the user the opportunity to verify documents before printing them (checking the correctness of account numbers, tax ID, REGON, etc.), using their own numbering of documents and dictionaries, balancing sales and purchases, creating cash reports, and using their own invoice templates. The advantage is the ability to export data to popular formats PDF, HTML, JPG, XML and sending documents by e-mail.
 
 Importantly, the program can be operated remotely via the Internet or a local network. Works with barcode readers, POSNET, THERMAL, and NOVITUS, QUATRO, DELIO or VIVO fiscal printers, as well as ELZAB and POSNET cash registers. There was also a backup option, allowing you to conveniently archive the data collected in the program.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 31 days.
