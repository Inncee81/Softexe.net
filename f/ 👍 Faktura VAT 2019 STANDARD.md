Application possibilities besides the basic invoicing function also include options for serial and recurring printing (subscription invoices), handling of multiple entities in one program (eg accounting offices), cash registers and transfers, preparation of postal printed forms, KP and KW, management of the list of contractors and offered goods, creating price lists, registering VAT and generating various sales reports, etc.
 
 VAT invoice 2019 STANDARD gives the user the opportunity to verify documents before printing them (checking the correctness of account numbers, tax ID, REGON, etc.), using their own numbering of documents and dictionaries, balancing sales and purchases, creating cash reports, and using their own invoice templates. The advantage is the ability to export data to popular formats PDF, HTML, JPG, XML, sending documents by e-mail and functions of addressing / sending documents and serial mail correspondence.
 
 Importantly, the program can be operated remotely via the Internet or a local network. Works with barcode readers, POSNET, THERMAL, and NOVITUS, QUATRO, DELIO or VIVO fiscal printers, as well as ELZAB and POSNET cash registers. There was also a backup option, allowing you to conveniently archive the data collected in the program.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 31 days.
