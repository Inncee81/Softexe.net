> File Ark is a tool for storing data "in the cloud", thanks to which we will save some space on physical media.

The free version of the application offers 1 GB of disk space, but you will also find paid variants here: for 200 GB of space you should pay $ 5 per month (almost PLN 20), while 1 TB is an expense of $ 20 (over PLN 76).
 
 File Ark is very easy to use. Just use the drag-and-drop technique to put your files on the server. However, from the level of the settings tab you can check how much space our data takes up, which we sent "to the cloud".
