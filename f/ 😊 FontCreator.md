The program offers a very transparent form in the area of ​​browsing installed fonts by placing a summary of them in one window (it contains the font name, type, file name and size). In addition, below you will find the path to write each font, so we can find it quickly without having to manually search the hard disk.
 
 FontCreator allows you to design high-quality fonts, both OpenType and TrueType. In addition, the application also allows you to create fonts to be placed on websites (Web Open Font Format). It is worth noting that the fonts will be compatible with all modern browsers.
 
 The FontCreator authors respect the user's time, which is why he can test his font in any application while working, and even generate a local website to check if the font matches the layout of the website. In the event of any incompatibilities, you can make appropriate corrections already in the font design phase.
