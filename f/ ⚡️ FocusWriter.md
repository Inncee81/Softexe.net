Thanks to this method the user can focus on the document, so it will not be distracted by other applications, indicators, etc. However, we can also use the program in a normal window adapted to individual needs. In addition, FocusWriter has a toolbar that hides automatically, as well as the ability to edit the background. We can choose a one-color background or load selected graphics from a computer disk. It is worth noting that the program allows you to create a database of themes that you can store. The application also allows you to use statistics on the text being created. They allow you to learn about the number of characters and poems, as well as time spent at work. In addition, the program offers functions typical for a text editor such as justification, searching and replacing text, bolding and italics or undoing changes. 
 
 In the current version, documents can be saved in TXT and RTF format.
