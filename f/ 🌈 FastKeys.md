> FastKeys is an easy-to-use program thanks to which we can automate various activities performed on the computer, both at work and during playing.

A very useful option, especially for people who write long articles on a computer, is a text expander. We can quickly enter specific phrases using defined letters, which saves a lot of time. FastKeys allows you to use this functionality in any applications installed on your hard drive.
 
 FastKeys allows you to prepare a fully customizable Windows Start Menu, which offers the ability to run any tool available on our computer. However, we do not have to mouse over the bottom left corner of the screen, but we can create keyboard shortcuts to use a single web browser, text editor or a computer game. The program also supports gestures made with the mouse.
 
 The characteristic feature of FastKeys is the number of options for adapting the tool to the user's needs. We will also find here the possibility of adjusting the volume, recording macros and managing data stored in the clipboard.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 15 days.
