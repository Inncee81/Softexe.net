> File Scavenger is a small but very useful data recovery application that has been lost in various circumstances. It supports both newer and older versions of the Windows operating system, including even Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.

Regardless of whether we want to restore data deleted due to hardware failure, virus or our error, File Scavenger will try to perform this operation as best as possible. The program recovers files from the hard disk, system bin or network drive. However, one must bear in mind that these data could not be permanently overwritten. If this happens, it will be impossible to recover them.
 
 File Scavenger is not a difficult tool to use. It allows you to specify the partition from which you want to recover data, as well as the type of files (eg ZIP archives, WMV sound files or PowerPoint presentations). By clicking the "scan" button we will start searching the HDD content, and after doing this the application will generate a detailed list of data to be restored. All we need to do is mark the file or directory that interests us, indicate the recording path and choose the "save" option.
 
 File Scavenger can also recover files from a formatted or damaged volume (basic or dynamic) even if it has been deleted. In this case, we do not need to know the original location of such a volume, nor the size.
 
 Interestingly, before you start using File Scavenger, you can choose whether you want to install it or run it in a portable version.
