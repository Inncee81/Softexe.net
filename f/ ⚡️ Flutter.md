This means that you no longer need to have separate tools, but you can use Flutter to make your work easier by creating applications both easier and faster. However, it should be remembered that Flutter is based on the Dart programming language, which may be an obstacle for some creators. The first applications using this tool may be slower, but once the experience is gained, the programmers will save a lot of time.   
 
 Flutter contains a rich set of fully customizable widgets, thanks to which we will design the application interface in a very short time, getting acquainted with the introduced changes in real time (on the screen of the mobile device). It is worth adding that by using advanced solutions, the tool can boast fast action. The original rendering engine makes it take only a moment, and the programmer does not have to prepare a separate interface for each version of the project.
 
 If you are just starting your adventure with writing mobile applications or would like to learn more about the possibilities offered by Flutter, we should read the official videos provided by Google on YouTube.
