The program looks quite inconspicuous, but despite its minimalism, it has a lot of valuable features that will certainly be appreciated by advanced users. First of all Textadept is focused on the fact that basically the entire program operation takes place via the keyboard, offering shortcuts for virtually every action and command. Thanks to the support of coloring and highlighting the code syntax for over 90 different programming languages, we can be sure that we will not get lost in hundreds of lines of code.
 
 Textadept also offers a module for automatically completing typed expressions, the ability to edit multiple documents in one application window, and allows you to personalize, among others, used colors. The whole is complemented by support for plugins and extensions created by the user community.
