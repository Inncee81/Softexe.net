Using the program will not cause any problems to anyone. After connecting an iPod, iPad or iPhone to a PC, we'll be able to import and export files, making it easy and fast to transfer them between iOS and Windows.
 
 In addition to the option to upload songs, videos, photos and any other data, TuneFab WeTrans also offers the option of backing up. It is worth using this function to create a back-up list of contacts or possessed SMSs just in case.
 
 TuneFab WeTrans also offers other, interesting solutions. With the help of this tool we will prepare new phone ringtones, we will be able to manage contacts (eg add or remove numbers), as well as convert HEIC pictures to JPEG or PNG files.
