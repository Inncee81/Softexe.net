TMPGEnc Video Mastering Works is an advanced, commercial tool designed to compress multimedia files. With its help, we can reduce the size of audio / video recordings, both those already compressed and deal with materials saved in lossless formats. The application supports all the most important and the most popular formats and codecs available on the market.

Among the supported formats can be mentioned for example DivX, MPEG-1/2/4, H.264, MOV, or Flash animations - similar freedom prevails among the available codecs, to which we can compress the resulting files. While working on the project, we can add external files with the soundtrack, make basic edits (cut unnecessary frames, trim the beginning or end) and apply a series of "enhancers" such as image trimming, color correction, noise reduction and more.
 
 The resulting files can be saved in a wide range of formats, there are also built-in templates allowing for automatic adjustment of settings to popular options, such as DVDs, Blu-Ray discs, or compatible with mobile devices. We can easily combine several audio and video files into one. The authors even predicted the possibility of adding slideshows to source files, which can also be edited from within the application.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 14 days. Watermarks are attached to the starting materials.
 An internet connection is required when you first start the application to obtain a test license.
