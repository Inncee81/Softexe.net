The program enables the playback of a wide range of materials from various sources. Using Tomahawk, we will open a library of songs from the computer's memory, as well as the server, the network, as well as popular services. We can then search and play content from YouTube or Skreemr and others. In addition, the program uses external tools like Playdar or Echonest (intelligent playlists). This allows, among other things, the use of suggestions on similar artists or genres. In this way, we can create playlists based on the length of the song, tags, song energy or volume.
 
 The application automatically searches for music material stored in the computer's memory as well as on connected external media. Other important functions are support for Last.fm, Jabber, Google Chat or Twitter. Thanks to this, we can easily share music and send information to friends. Tomahawk also allows you to display information about recently played songs or lists.
 
 An interesting solution is the possibility of installing add-ons extending the program's capabilities. For example, with Playlick, you can import metadata for playlists from Last.fm, Spotify, XSPF or podcasts. In turn, Tomahawklet captures playlists from websites and allows you to import them into the program.
 
 The program is no longer officially developed, the developers informed about the possibility of developing its functions independently. The application code is available on the GitHub website .
