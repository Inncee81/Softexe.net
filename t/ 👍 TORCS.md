```sh
After launching Torcs, we see a so-called preliminary menu in which we enter game options. We set cars, name, graphics, keyboards and the like there. If we cope with all this, there is nothing else but to press the Single Player. And here comes a slight shock, because the fun is chosen from among the five main races, they are: Quick Race, Non-Championship, Championship, DTM Race and Practice. The most important thing to be feared in such games is the behavior of our car on the road. In Torcs, each car is differently controlled, one has better turns, but worse acceleration, the other is the opposite, so it is worth spending some time to choose a vehicle that perfectly suits our taste, so that later in the game itself, do not have a problem with staying on the road.

The graphics in the game are difficult to assess. The performance of vehicles is on the medium level, it looks worse than in similar production, which is Trigger. The route is very much, but only three deserve recognition, are colorful, interesting, nice to just go, the rest is a winding road with a meadow carpet and here I have a little regret to the authors, because it looks as if they were made forcibly, carelessly and too fast. Another thing is the feeling of speed, which is also not too good. Driving 200 km / h you get the impression that the car is moving up to 50 km / h, well in the initial stage it bothers it a bit, later it's a bit less, but the mere fact of doing something, spoils the fun. As for the sounds, they are even pleasant and it is difficult for me to say something about this subject in this option.
