Harmony gives a huge field to the animators. The program offers a lot of drawing tools (perfectly compatible with Wacom tablets), a time line or a mobile camera that allows you to get a 3D effect. An exceptional hit is the Automated Lip Synching option of automatically adapting the mouth animation to the soundtrack (the function is independent of the language in which the character communicates). You can animate both frame by frame and using keyframes.
 
 The program allows you to import files: AI, PSD, SWF, PDF, BMP, TGA, GIF, JPG, PICT, SGI, WAV, AIFF, MP3 and export to: SWF, MOV, PDF, DV, AVI.
 Attention!
 
 Before downloading the program, you must log in to the manufacturer's website.
