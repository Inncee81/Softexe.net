> Tag &amp; Rename is - according to what the name suggests - a program to change the name of music tracks and dress them with various tags.

Tags turn out to be salutary when the user has a substantial library of songs. Thanks to them, we can quickly locate songs that we want to review or listen to. That's why it's worth taking care of the order in the collection, making use of the Tag &amp; Rename tool that supports the most popular sound file formats.
 
 Tag &amp; Rename supports MP3 (tags ID3v1, ID3v2.2, ID3v2.3 and ID3v2.4), Windows Media files (WMA, ASF and WMV), Apple iTunes AAC files (M4A), including MP4, lossless M4A and M4P protected, and also other formats: Ogg Vorbis, Flac, Opus, Speex, MusePack MPC / MP + (APEv1, APEv2 and ID3v1 tags) and the most popular lossless audio codecs: Monkey's Audio, Flac, Wav Pack, Optim Frog, True Audio, Apple, Windows Media, WAV, AIFF and DSF (Direct Stream Digital).
 
 Importantly, Tag &amp; Rename allows you to enter data manually, but it can also work in batch mode. It is also possible to automatically update titles and album covers (Amazon and Discogs) and album names from the tracktype.org server. There was also a function of exporting information about files to XLS, CSV and HTML formats and importing tags from XLS.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
