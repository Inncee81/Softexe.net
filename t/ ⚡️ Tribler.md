Tribler is a kind of torrent client that allows you to safely download files from other users of the service using the "peer-to-peer" function. Now, to download the desired torrent, there is no need to register on some trackers, maintain the ratio of reception / return, etc. - just enter the name of the desired file, and if another user of the network has it, then you can download it without further ado.

And if you already have a .torrent extension file on your PC, you can also “pull” it into the program and load the data of interest.

It is worth noting that Tribler operates on the basis of technology, the principle of which is similar to the work of the anonymous Tor network, which allows users to remain incognito when sharing information: all data is transmitted through several access points.

For convenience, a media player is built directly into the program, so you can start viewing / listening to the file right during the download, without waiting for the final download.

The main characteristics of the program:


downloading files using peer-to-peer technology,
quick search for information by keyword
file size slider filter
support for downloading standard torrent files,
complete anonymity of work with the program,
the ability to start viewing media content until full download,
maintaining a list of selected sources, etc.
