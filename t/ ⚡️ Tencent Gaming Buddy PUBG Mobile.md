In the emulator settings, you can choose graphical options, the resolution available for the game (from 720p to 4K), rendering engine settings and the like. In addition, the emulator gives you the ability to change the keys assigned to the action in the game. Default keys are standard for shooters - WSAD are used to move, mouse is aiming and shooting.
 
 It is worth noting that for equalizing opportunities, players using emulators will be connected to teams that also use emulators. 
 
 Although the emulator is aware of the presence of the keyboard, in some situations (entering the name, chatting) the screen keyboard will be visible.
