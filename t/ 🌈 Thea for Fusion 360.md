```sh
Thea for Fusion 360 is a plug-in for using the Thea renderer in Autodesk Fusion 360. The installer will add a plug-in for Fusion, as well as a standalone version of the program that lets you prepare the scene for rendering, apply materials and add lights to scenes.

Thea Renderer is a great rendering engine that generates photorealistic images and animations. There are three rendering mechanisms available here. TR1 / TR2 treats rendering like a simulation and is perfect for simulating caustics and light scattering. Adaptive interpolation algorithms reproduce the image using perceptual mechanisms, making it seem more realistic. You can also opt for the correct mathematical calculation of light rays propagation and interactive rendering with proprietary Presto, using the CPU and GPU (preferably NVIDIA CUDA and at least CUDA 6.5, Compute Capability 2.0).
 
 Thea also has a rich library of licensed materials available only here and copes well with materials exported by Fusion 360. After installing Thea Renderer for Fusion from the program, you can quickly launch Thea Studio and send it a model for rendering, modify materials and design the environment.
 
 
 The demo version of the renderer allows you to check all its possibilities, but it puts a watermark on images and animations.
