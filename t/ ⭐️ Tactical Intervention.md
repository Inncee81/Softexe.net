Tactical Intervention is a free shooting game, which should be primarily interested in Counter-Strike fans because the head of the project was Minh Le, co-creator of the network hit in 2000.

Terrorists and anti-terrorists are once again struggling with each other, but vehicles and even dogs join the game. Once again, the basis of the fun is not only the trained eye and fast hand, but also the selection of equipment. Graphically, the production can not match the modern hits because it works on the source engine used by Half-Life games, but carries a sweet breeze from the old school of creating FPS projects.
 
 The gameplay can take place in two basic modes. Tactical Intervention offers both team deathmatch, which means knocking enemies together to the designated kill limit as well as playing the mission. Fulfilling certain assumptions and knocking out enemies brings better equipment to the next challenge. 
 
 In the game, we will participate in several available scenarios. They are divided into those in which we reflect hostages, put or disarm bombs, or escort specific people for a specific purpose or what they carry in their luggage. Undoubtedly, an interesting addition is the ability to use various elements of the environment (eg gas cylinders), ride down ropes or even using hostages as live shields.
 
 Tactical Intervention is characterized by high dynamics of action and energetic gameplay. In addition to constant shooting and constant striving to enslave enemy units, we will also encounter elements of tactics and strategy. Thanks to the good audiovisual setting and high playability, the title will surely provide many hours of fun.
 
 Attention!
 In order to install the game, you should download the Steam program - a special online platform that allows you not only to buy and download computer games, but also to stay in touch with friends, which we can at any time invite to the game.
