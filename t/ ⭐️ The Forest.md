The character driven by the player was the only one who survived the plane crash, which crashed in a mysterious forest inhabited by a society of cannibal mutants. Obviously, the protagonist's task is to survive in these extremely unfavorable conditions. In the first place, he must find the means necessary to keep himself alive, and in time try to get a fire and build a shelter.
 
 During the day at The Forest we will explore, get equipment, create new objects and build, while at night we fight against genetically mutated enemies who will do everything to destroy our base and send us to the other world. Direct confrontation is not always the best solution, especially since we will initially have only a primitive tool made of sticks and stones. Therefore, sometimes it is worth thinking about avoiding enemies or eliminating them from hiding.
 
 The Forest offers an extensive system of interaction with the environment. Practically every tree and every plant can be cut down to use the prey for its own purposes. It only depends on us whether during the campaign we decide to set up a modest camp or a large ocean fortress. In any case, we will have to deal with both the element and the opponents mentioned above.
