TinyTask is a tool that allows you to automate operations performed on your computer. Thanks to it, we will not only save a lot of time, but also energy in everyday work.

The TinyTask interface is extremely minimal because it consists only of six icons placed on the bar. The most important of them is blue, or REC, which is responsible for recording activities performed by the user (mouse clicks, opening programs, etc.). After pressing each operation carried out on the computer is recorded - after finishing the work, we can save it and then play it back at any time.
 
 Interestingly, the recorded macros can be played in normal or accelerated mode. In addition, TinyTask offers a looping function, so the action can be repeated many times without having to run the macro each time.
 
 TinyTask allows you to save the created macros to the REC format and to the EXE executable file. In the second case, we do not need any additional application to run the macro, which can be especially useful when we want to share it with another user.
