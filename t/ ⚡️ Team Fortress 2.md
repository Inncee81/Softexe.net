> Team Fortress 2 is a team multiplayer FPS which is a continuation of the famous Team Fortress Classic. However, it gave up the realistic approach to gameplay and the best possible reproduction of reality.

Thanks to the use of the new Source engine, the creators managed to move away from the effects of the modern world, giving the game a comedic, ironic atmosphere and being doused with a comic sauce. Everything is exaggerated here with the intention of giving not only a grotesque aftertaste, but also highlighting all the most important, individual psychomotor qualities of each character.
 
 The main axis on which the idea of ​​Team Fortress 2 is based is to divide the players into 9 classes in two teams. The classes are divided into three categories: offensive, defensive and supportive. The first one is undoubtedly the Scout - a young man with an idea for guerilla, a Soldier - a typical military tough guy and Pyro - a flame thrower operator. The group of defenders is first of all Fat - an overgrown Russian with great power obsessed with his weapon, then Demoman - a drunkard who has hit the paws with a grenade launcher and an adhesive bomb launcher and an Engineer - his peasant who knows the rapid construction of plots and teleports. All of them are supported bravely by the Medic - effeminate physician saving life only by means of known methods,
 
 We can try our strength in the game in several available modes on a dozen or so maps. It is a specific mode that defines the purpose of the game. Among the modes, for example, we can take over territories, consisting in attacking and defending specific areas of the map. The fight here can last for a very long time, or end quickly - it all depends on who we are dealing with. The most popular seems to be the mode, which is the version of the known and popular "capture the flag". In Team Fortress 2, instead of the flag, we steal a briefcase with closely guarded documents. On Payload maps, one of the teams must escort the bomb trolley through several checkpoints to detonate the missile at the enemy base at the end. The opposing team must defend their positions and prevent the stroller from reaching the final checkpoint within a certain time.
 
 Team Fortress 2 has a great audiovisual setting, thanks to which you can not tear your eyes or ears off the game. You can not encounter an unredeemed form, Sniper is a big-tempered man in sunglasses, using a long rifle with an unusually large telescope, Pyro - a fireman running in a gas mask that suppresses his voice, and if you throw a medic with a pitcher, you will hear some muffled slam. Equally unscrewed, what character classes, is the very binding of the mission. Once we connect to a map, a lady who uses as absurd as it is in a high-pitched voice will explain to us what is going on in a given mode. 
 
 The grotesque-comic atmosphere of the game perfectly adapts to the convention of fun, but at the same time, it is fun, addictive and at the same time forcing team play. Attention, because after playing in Team Fortress 2, realistic shooters may seem boring to pain.
 
 
 Attention:
 
 In order to install the game, you should download the Steam program - a special online platform that not only allows you to buy (it is worth mentioning that Team Fortress 2 is completely free) and downloading computer games, but also constant contact with friends, which we can at any time invite for the game.
