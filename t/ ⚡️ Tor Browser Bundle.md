The program ensures full security when using the Internet network, and also protects the user's data and guarantees full anonymity. The Tor Browser Bundle is integrated with the Mozilla Firefox web browser, so when using the program, we do not need to install external programs for browsing the web. 
 
 
 Keep in mind that the program provides protection to the user if he only uses the built-in Firefox browser. The Tor Browser Bundle provides anonymity and privacy when browsing websites. We get an anonymous IP address that helps hide the real identity and additionally provides protection against burglary. 
 
 
 Tor Browser Bundle is an extremely useful program to hide your own data and all traces on the Internet. After connecting to the Tor network, we can browse websites freely, as well as conduct conversations using instant messengers. The operation of the program is very simple. Just run it in Windows and after a while it will automatically connect to the Tor network, and also enable the built-in Mozilla Firefox browser. It also has a huge number of different configuration options, through which we can set up a connection to the Tor network and establish a new TCP connection by entering a different IP address.
