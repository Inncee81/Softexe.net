The application gives you the ability to create and view multiple task lists at the same time. Within each of them we can create individual tasks and subtasks, divide existing tasks into smaller ones, set notifications or send them via e-mail. ToDoList allows the user to define many of the various attributes associated with each task. He can declare the percentage level of completing the task, the amount of time spent on the task or remaining to complete it, catalog and tag tasks, mark different colors, etc.
 
 ToDoList allows you to import tasks created in the Microsoft Outlook mail client. In turn, the export of letters can take place in the formats FreeMind (MM), GanttProject (GAN), iCalendar (ICS), TXT, CSV and HTML. Importantly, the program allows many users to work on the project at the same time.
