```sh
TexMaths is an extension for LibreOffice, allowing to use TeX in a package when generating formulas, equations and even illustrations. For the add-on to work, a LaTeX implementation is needed, for example MikTeX. After installing it, you should indicate the path to the programs responsible for compiling and generating images.

The preamble is generated automatically, the user only has to enter the code of his equation. You can insert a PNG or SVG image into the document. Formulas can be placed with numbers within a document or in the text, in the form of images treated as a sign. 
 
 
 The extension is written in English, the French version is also available.
