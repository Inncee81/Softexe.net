Written in Java and developed by the ASF foundation together with independent programmers from around the world as part of the Apache project. As a basic startup environment, it uses a Java virtual machine, well known among home users. Tomcat is used in such JEE (J2EE) application servers as JBoss and Apache Geronimo. It contains the entire package of tools that simplify the configuration and management of applications.
 
 Attention!
 On the official website of the project you can find documentation (unfortunately only in the English version), which describes how to install, configure and run Tomcat.
