The tool is used for version control. It allows you to make changes and corrections while working on extended projects involving many people. TortoiseSVN offers the option of automatically uploading and merging files, as well as synchronizing data, which is especially useful when a large number of programmers are involved.
 
 TortoiseSVN contains an extensive commit dialog, a tool for creating graphics and statistics, a code snipping wizard, an application for checking changes in text files (TortoiseMerge), an additional program offering access to information on changes in each line of code (TortoiseBlame) and a comparison engine two graphic files (TortoiseIDiff).
 
 It is worth adding that TortoiseSVN fully integrates with Windows Explorer, which effectively simplifies the work. When writing about the advantages of the program, it should also be noted that it offers numerous configuration options for more experienced and demanding recipients.
 
 Attention!
 Crack to the program is available in the section PROGRAMS -&gt; Extras -&gt; Polish locations (see: Related Programs).
