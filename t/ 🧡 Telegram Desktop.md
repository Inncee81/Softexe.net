Telegram Desktop is an instant messenger that allows you to send text messages, photos, videos and files saved in various formats (doc, zip, mp3, etc.), as well as creating groups of up to 200 users.

The application is addressed mainly to enterprises and small businesses whose employees communicate with each other via the Internet using computers, tablets or smartphones. It works on Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, iOS, Android and Windows Phone systems. It can be an interesting alternative to the popular WhatsApp, which is available only on mobile platforms. In contrast, it is based on the cloud, thanks to which we can access the archive of messages and contact lists from several devices at the same time.
 
 The communicator contains a built-in graphic editor, which can be useful in everyday work, if you want, for example, to quickly crop a given image or change its position. After performing these operations, we can share the file with other users using the application. The number of shared files is not limited, but their total weight can not exceed 1.5 GB.
 
 Telegram Desktop has a clear and minimal user interface. On the left there is a search engine and a list of contacts, while on the right there is a window with a conversation. At the top there are buttons that allow you to change application settings and manage contacts.
 
 Telegram Desktop requires the creation of a free account for which you must log in to use the program. If we want, we can personalize them. The avatar of our profile can be placed next to the name and surname.
