The program supports coordinate systems from around the world - including Polish state and local systems, global adjustments in the "1965" layout, and also allows you to create your own systems based on known parameters. TranMap can transform on the basis of defined customization points, supporting external databases. It is possible to carry out the transformation of many files simultaneously and data stored in the clipboard.
 
 TranMap gives you the ability to transform coordinates stored in the form of text files, DXF and created in CAD environments (MicroStation, AutoCAD and IntelliCAD).
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
