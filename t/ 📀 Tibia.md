```sh
Free Tibia can be proud of great popularity, despite the fact that this MMO game about simple graphics appeared on the market several decades ago. Here every day a pixelated fantasy world is visited by thousands of adventurous adventurers, and among them you can find really many native players. Archaic solutions do not deter the product, on the contrary. They make it simply unique.

The action is shown in an isometric view, as it was in former RPG projects. Not very complicated rules, however, offer a lot of character development opportunities, make the game easy to learn even for younger computer users. Players of course have several hero classes. They can be, among others knights, paladins or wizards and explore the land-divided lands in search of more powerful objects and new monsters to liquidate.
 
 
 The climate is the main thing behind the product. Often in this MMO we encounter friendly strangers who rescue them from oppression, supporting them even in battle. For those who like to face a live opponent, there is also an option of fighting with each other. There are also guilds. Individualists will appreciate the fact that they can change the appearance of a character, and develop it indefinitely, if only they find time for it.
 
 
 Tibia is free, but you can buy a Premium account. Thanks to this, they will visit areas normally closed to other players, use the option of fast movement between locations, get more spells to use or raise their hero to the rank of a veteran, gaining useful opportunities. The hero can also train himself alone when we are not playing.
 
 
 Minimum system requirements:
 
 500 MHz processor
 Graphics card compatible with DirectX 5.0
 
 
 Attention!
 
 
 For the fun you will need to create a free account , which you must log in later.
