Tabby Cat - a purely entertaining addition to Chrome that can appeal primarily to children or cat lovers. Thanks to the extension, each consecutive open card in the browser will show us the cartoon character of the animal, often with additional toys or accessories.

Each cat is also given an unusual, two-part, English-speaking name. The program can also be an inspiration for people looking for an interesting name for their own pet. Apart from the laughing function, it is in vain to look for useful functions in the application.
 
 It is worth mentioning that if one of the cats we particularly like and we want to immortalize him for the future, we have the built-in capability to take screenshots.
