The Stanley Parable is a first-person exploration game in which the player takes on the title Stanley, but also does not take on him. Following the story, we do not follow her at the same time, but we explore our own problems. When making a choice, we realize that we do not really choose anything. The game is full of contradictions and paradoxes, and at the same time strongly bends the rules of building video games.
 
 Slow exploration of the game world will allow us to find some sense in it. The choices we make in the game depend on which ending we play. According to critics, there is more reflection on their own existence than entertainment, although fans of black humor will find a lot of great situations in it and will laugh through tears.
 
 The Stanley Parable was created based on the fashion for the Source engine of the same name, released in 2011. Not only her dark humor and psychoanalysis fun deserves praise, but also the excellent narration recorded by Kevan Brighting
 
 
 The demo is not a fragment of the game. Instead, the creators show us what we can expect in full play, showing "facilities".
