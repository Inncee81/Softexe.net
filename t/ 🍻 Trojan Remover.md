The application, apart from the scanning option, also has an extensive database of malware, in which you can find a number of information about the behavior of specific malware programs. Trojan Remover is very useful at the moment when the antivirus program used by the user detects an unwanted malware, but will not be able to cope with its removal.
 
 Trojan Remover, despite the English language version, is very simple and intuitive to use.
