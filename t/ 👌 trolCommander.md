It should be noted that trolCommander does not have excessive hardware requirements, but it is necessary to have an operating system that supports Java (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, BSD). The program supports many protocols, such as: FTP, SFTP, SMB, NFS, HTTP, Amazon S3, Hadoop HDFS and Bonjour. 
 
 trolCommander also allows you to view, create and decompress archives. The supported formats include: IP, RAR, 7z, TAR, GZip, BZip2, ISO / NRG, AR / Deb and LST. The program has been equipped with a standard, double-panel user interface with tabs, so that the use of it will be easy for both less and more experienced users.
