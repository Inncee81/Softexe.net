```sh
Tuxler is a free VPN tool in the form of an overlay for Firefox, thanks to which we not only protect your privacy during everyday use of the network, but also gain access to all websites.

Generally, it seems that every user can read the content of any web site, but in fact some of them are blocked for various reasons (eg to protect copyrights in a given territory). As a VPN client, Tuxler abolishes this limitation and at the same time makes the user anonymous.
 
 Therefore, Tuxler allows you to free up your IP address by choosing a new one from a huge database that contains only real data. The authors of the program did not provide any restrictions for people using the free version, who can send any amount of data and change the IP many times depending on the needs.
 
 After installing the plug-in, Tuxler is available in the upper right corner of the Firefox interface. Just click on the icon located there and change the option from "disconnect" to "connect" with one mouse cursor shift to start using this overlay.
