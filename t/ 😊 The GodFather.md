The described files can be cataloged according to many different criteria. The program also allows you to create playlists, export the list of owned resources to XLS or HTML files, and also has a built-in player.
 
 It supports files in many popular formats, eg MP3, OGG, MPC, APE, FLAC, AAC, APL, MP4, unfortunately with the exception of WMA.Attention!
 In order to select the Polish language interface, start the Options menu and select the "Use language file" window. Then, using the folder icon, indicate the file "polish.lng", which, with the standard installation, should be in the "C: Program FilesThe GodFatherLng" folder. In order for the changes to take effect, the program must be restarted.
