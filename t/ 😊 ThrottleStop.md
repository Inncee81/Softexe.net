> ThrottleStop is a small application for laptop users, which allows you to monitor the operation of the processor, as well as modify various parameters of this system.

Thanks to ThrottleStop we can even reduce the CPU performance. This will affect the computer, but it will allow us to increase the battery life, which may be useful, for example, when traveling, when we do not have to burden the processor to the maximum extent.
 
 On the left side of the main program window there are mentioned options for modifying the CPU work, while the right contains a monitoring panel, thanks to which we will be able to keep track of changes in the scope of individual processor threads and adjust them if necessary.
 
 When using ThrottleStop, remember to use the power supply to avoid irreparable damage (both the power supply and the CPU as well as the entire computer!).
