Topaz Adjust is one of the most interesting tools in the manufacturer's offer, giving the possibility to modify a wide range of parameters of our photos. Using it, we will increase the tonal range, correct the overexposed and underexposed areas of the picture in order to recover the details contained in them, or sharpen the blurred parts of the image. The tool also allows you to create images in HDR technology from just one image of a given frame. This feature gives us the opportunity to increase the local contrast, depth of color and detail, in such a way that photography reflects to a large extent what the human eye can see.
 
 Apart from the mentioned functions, one should also mention the set of presets offered by Topaz Adjust (predefined settings), with the help of which inexperienced photography amateurs can efficiently and comfortably improve the quality of their photos. All we have to do is point at the selected preset and it will be applied on the loaded image. The creators have prepared a set of settings for photographs of various types - landscape photos, architecture or portraits.
 
 The extension is compatible with Adobe Photoshop CS3-CS6 (32-bit and 64-bit), Photoshop Elements 6-11, PaintShop Pro , Photo Impact and Serif Photo Plus, as well as Adobe Lightroom 2-4.Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the extension for 30 days.
