> Trigger Rally is at first glance inconspicuous rally game, which, however, is very addictive, if you spend a moment of time. Graphically, it can not be compared to commercial productions, but a good ride model, as well as fun from entertainment, should be envied by its many paid title. The creators gave at our disposal an extensive set of different routes, significantly different from each other.

There are also three cars to choose from, of course modeled on the most popular models of cars used by rally drivers. Available maps present a wide range of topics. From simply gliding ahead in the mud, sand or grass, the player will also quickly go eg to mystic lands full of colorful obelisks. The routes are based on specially crafted graphics files and it's easy to add yours here.
  
 
 The project offers several play modes. The basic one is participation in one of the selected fictitious championships, which consist of trips within a given pool of seats. In addition, there is also a separate training option, in order to prepare for tournaments, plus start on any chosen route. Of course it is possible to change the camera setting, so fans watching action from the bumper can easily play this way.
