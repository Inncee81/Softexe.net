TunnelBear is a cross-platform VPN client that allows you to safely surf the Internet, hide confidential data from prying eyes and gain access to websites prohibited in your country.

The meaning of VPN technology is to encrypt and redirect all outgoing traffic through the so-called tunnel servers, where the real IP address and location are replaced with virtual ones. As a result, for all tracking modules, services, and unscrupulous users, you will be displayed as a user of another country, and the possibility of leakage of personal information becomes almost impossible.

In TunnelBear, you can use several servers in countries such as the USA, UK, Canada, Germany, Japan, Switzerland, Australia, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Italy and Spain.

Working with TunnelBear is very simple: choose any location from the list and use the "On" / "Off" knob to control the tunneling.

Note. Free service TunnelBear offers to use only 500MB of redirected traffic per month. If more is needed, then you need to switch to a paid subscription.
