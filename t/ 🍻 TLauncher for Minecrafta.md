> TLauncher is one of the simplest (unofficial) launchers for the Minecraft sanboks game, which is created and developed by the Russians. Thanks to it, we can easily download and install on your computer any edition of the game (including development editions), as well as adjust the gameplay to individual preferences.

The service of the tool is not complicated, and the Polish language version is certainly an additional advantage for new users. After starting the TLauncher, a player profile should be created, and then the selected editions of Minecraft should be downloaded and installed. Importantly, the tool allows you to install more than one edition of the game and supports versions from the first development to the latest 1.12.2.
 
 Other functions of TLauncher are the choice of the location where the game should be installed, definition of the resolution and whether the game should be played in full-screen mode, adding arguments for JVM and allocation of the operating memory. 
 
 TLauncher has been made available for the most popular system platforms - Windows, Linux and Mac OS.
