Thanks to TweakPower, we can not only remove unnecessary tools, fix errors on disks, as well as problems present in the Windows operating system, but also manage the list of programs run with the computer and defragment the hard disk. After performing these operations, we will certainly feel that applications load much faster, games run more smoothly, and copying files takes less time.
 
 TweakPower includes a special Turbo mode, in which the described program disables 70 unnecessary processes in the Windows operating system, which affects the performance of our equipment. You can use it both when browsing websites, and while playing or watching movies.
 
 However, if we want to extend the battery life in the laptop, we should start the Economy mode responsible for less energy consumption by the processor (turning off unnecessary processes running in the background) and internal and external devices. 
 
 TweakPower also allows you to back up selected files and system restore point. Thanks to this, we can restore Windows settings to the previous state if necessary. Computer protection is also possible by configuring and managing firewall settings, automatic updates or user accounts. If necessary, you can permanently delete confidential data or encrypt it using the AES algorithm.
