Through the program, we can purchase new maps and accessories, and then copy them directly to the device or memory card in the computer reader. If we have a valid subscription and log in to the program, we can freely download the available updates and also synchronize them with the device or card. In addition to the maps themselves, TomTom also allows you to purchase or download free of pilot's voice, information about speed cameras, navigation facilities and MapShare map corrections developed on the basis of data provided by the driver community.
 
 Depending on the type of device, TomTom HOME also allows you to purchase or extend the subscription of LIVE services, which provide information on traffic jams, inconveniences and accidents on a regular basis while driving. In some cases, for example in integrated navigation systems of some car brands, a visit to the dealer is necessary to use the LIVE subscription, which the program will inform you when you try to buy it.
 
 The program interface is very simple and has been translated into Polish. If the copied map does not fit into the device or on the card, we have the option to choose a specific zone, though not completely free as in some of TomTom's competing solutions. Before copying, the program offers to back up data from the device or card. Such copy is saved on the computer disk.
