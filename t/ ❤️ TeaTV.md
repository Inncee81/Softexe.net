After launching TeaTV, we immediately get access to the main program window, where we can see the available content divided into numerous categories not only in terms of the type of content, but also popularity among viewers. All you need to do is click a few clicks to start watching your video made available on a streaming basis (if you have a slower link, you should choose a lower quality image from the list of sources, eg 480p).
 
 TeaTV allows you to create a playlist, and also allows you to view the history of the viewed material. In addition, the user can use the function of downloading movies, series or TV programs to watch them offline. In case of any problems with the operation of the tool, we can use a special form, describing the issue in English.
