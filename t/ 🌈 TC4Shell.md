Using the TC4Shell program is very simple, because the application integrates with Windows Explorer and allows the use of drag-and-drop and also allows you to copy or paste files. By right-clicking on selected files, we can perform various operations related to, for example, packing them into an archive and sending them via e-mail.
 
 An additional option included in TC4Shell is easy-to-use password management, which is used to secure file archives. This feature will prove extremely useful for users sending or receiving confidential data.
