TransOver is a small extension for the Google Chrome browser, acting as a simple translator, which allows the translation of individual words and phrases on foreign-language websites.

After installation, the plugin should be configured and, despite the lack of a Polish language version, this operation should not cause any problems to anyone. There are options for defining the output language (to which the content should be translated), activating the Text-to-Speech function, selecting the translator launch key, delaying the translation display, or creating site lists on which TransOver is to operate or not.
 
 TransOver's operation is very simple. After switching to a foreign language website, just move the mouse cursor or click (action defined in the settings) the selected word and a small speech bubble will appear next to it.
