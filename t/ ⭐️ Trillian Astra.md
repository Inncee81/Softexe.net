Against the background of the competition, it stands out due to its high functionality and a user-friendly graphical interface. The program gives the possibility of text communication (in the paid version also voice and video), conducting conferences, access to the mailbox from the messenger, support for widgets and graphic themes, file transfer and an expanded message archive module. An interesting feature is the possibility of extensive text formatting in the conversation window, as well as sending drawings (sketched directly in the messenger chat window) to contacts on our list.
 
 The undoubted disadvantage of Trillian Astra is the lack of available Polish language version of the messenger, the lack of support for the most popular GG network in Poland and social networking sites (nasza-klasa.pl, fotka.pl).
