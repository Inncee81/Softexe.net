> TotalD is a more and more popular, free tool for comprehensive data downloading from the Internet. It is a combination of a standard download manager, a BitTorrent client and a video download program from Youtube, Vimeo, Dailymotion and Veoh.

The program is very easy to use and significantly simplifies the download of all kinds of data from the Internet. Shortly after installation and commissioning, it allows downloading previously described files from various sources. TotalD constantly monitors the content of the system clipboard and if only there are any links to files, torrents or videos in Youtube, the tool can capture and download them. Of course, it is also possible to manually add links to download in the main program window, as well as to open containers with links (files in DLC, RSDF, CCF format).
 
 Among the many options contained in this would seem a simple program can be found, among others excluding capturing links from specific sources, limiting the download speed, the number of files downloaded at the same time, the number of connections per file or the number of attempts to download after failure. TotalD also allows automatic unpacking of downloaded archives to a specific location, support for premium accounts on many popular hosting sites or, in the case of the embedded BitTorrent client, UPNP and NAT-PMP port mapping.
 
 Attention!
 
 The free version has a restriction that prevents you from downloading clips from YouTube-type websites in the highest quality. If you want to avoid these inconveniences you should purchase a license for the Pro edition.
