> TicketCreator is a tool for creating and printing admission tickets. We can use it at home (all you need is the application and printer described).

The program is extremely easy to use, and the preparation of professional admission tickets is based on a few simple steps. With TicketCreator, we'll create tickets that we give to people invited to various events or meetings (eg school sports or theatrical performances) or we will distribute them at specific points of sale. In the last case, it is worth thinking about securing the ticket before copying by placing a bar code on it that can be read using another tool, BarcodeChecker.
 
 TicketCreator offers many options, thanks to which we will put not only the name of the event on the ticket, but also a lot of other valuable information, such as the government and the place number. Interestingly, the program allows you to prepare one-time tickets, multi-day or seasonal tickets. Some events may last a whole weekend, and sometimes it is also worth thinking about designing passes.
