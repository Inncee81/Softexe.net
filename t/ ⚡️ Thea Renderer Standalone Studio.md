Thea Renderer is a great rendering engine that generates photorealistic images and animations. We have adaptive interpolation algorithms, correct mathematical simulation of light propagation and interactive rendering with the proprietary Presto engine. Thea has a rich library of licensed materials, available only in this program, and its own "studio" in which you can set models, put materials on them and add lights to the scenes.

Thea Renderer allows you to compose scenes from many models, also imported in various formats (3DS, OBJ and others). The instance brush lets you quickly and accurately arrange repetitive objects on the stage using changes in size and position. The studio has also been equipped with an advanced material editor (also working independently), allowing you to create textures and precisely choose colors, also by previewing the material in different light. The Relight editor allows you to work with images with different groups of lights.
 
 
 The studio also has its own "Darkroom", where you can postproduce the rendered image, improving the exposure, applying filters or performing photometric analysis. Almost all corrections can be made while the image is being rendered. Animation editor in Thea Renderer allows you to guide the camera along the chosen path, which works great when presenting products or interior designs.
 
 
 
 Thea requires a NVIDIA CUDA graphics card (at least CUDA 6.5, Compute Capability 2.0). The demo version puts a watermark on the rendered image.
