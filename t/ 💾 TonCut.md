The use of the TonCut software allows enterprises to significantly reduce the waste during the execution of the pattern (up to 10%). In addition, thanks to the optimal layout of sheets on sheets, it is also possible to reduce material, work and product costs and reduce production time. Searching for the right layout for the spreadsheet takes only a few seconds, and results in a printout or cutting file with exact placement of the sheets.
 
 TonCut does not require any additional equipment other than a computer and a printer. It also offers a plug-in mechanism that allows you to extend the application capabilities with new features.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
