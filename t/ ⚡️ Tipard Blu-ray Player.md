Tipard Blu-ray Player is characterized by a modern, very clear user interface, which in comparison with other programs of this type does not stand out anything special. With its help, we can watch movies in 1080p resolution, and if we have the right TV or monitor, it's worth remembering that the player also supports 4K quality. The supported video file formats include: MP4, MKV, AVI, WMV, MOV and others.
 
 Tipard Blu-ray Player allows you to select the audio track and subtitles while playing a Blu-ray movie. It is also possible to create stop-frames, which by default are saved in JPG format, but the program also supports PNG and BMP.
 
  
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version of the Tipard Blu-ray Player allows you to use the program for 30 days.
