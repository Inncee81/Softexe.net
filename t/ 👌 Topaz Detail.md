The tool allows us to conveniently process photos for sharpening, for example, slightly blurred or noisy images. It offers more effective mechanisms to increase image detail than competing, allowing for selective editing of selected fragments. In addition, it has tools for three-level separation of internal details and tones, giving the possibility of full control over the processed images without side effects in the form of distortions or artifacts.
 
 
 In addition to basic functions, one should also mention the set of predefined settings offered by Topaz Simplify, with the help of which inexperienced photography enthusiasts can efficiently and easily process their photographs. All we have to do is point at the selected preset and it will be applied on the loaded image.
 
 The extension is compatible with Adobe Photoshop CS3-CS6 (32-bit and 64-bit), Photoshop Elements 6-11, PaintShop Pro , Photo Impact and Serif Photo Plus, as well as Adobe Lightroom 2-4.
 
  Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the extension for 30 days.
