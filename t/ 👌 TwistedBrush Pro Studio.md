TwistedBrush Pro Studio provides digital equivalents of brushes characterized by a very high degree of realism. Depending on the speed of brush movement, the selected color is applied with different intensity. For each brush you can set the right density, size, transparency and color available on one of eight palettes. The TwistedBrush Pro Studio program offers features such as handling filters, masks (read / write), plugins, work on layers, the ability to choose different types of canvas, paint images on the background of photography, create slide shows, custom color palettes and much more.
 
 The authors have also made sure that the Pro version offers users a large number of realistic tools, which currently are over 1,400. Finished projects can be saved and exported to many formats.
