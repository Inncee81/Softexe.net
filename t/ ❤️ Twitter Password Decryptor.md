The program allows you to recover your username and password to our profile on the Twitter social network, which is stored in your web browser. It allows you to efficiently search and decrypt the data you need, if in the past, we have successfully logged in to Twitter on the previous occasion. Twitter Password Decryptor automatically searches for supported applications on the computer, and then instantly recovers all logins and passwords from the information collected by it and presents them in the form of a list.
 
 The tool can restore all data provided by the user when logging in to Twitter using Internet Explorer version 4 to 10, Firefox, Google Chrome, CoolNovo, Opera, Safari, Flock, Comodo Dragon, SeaMonkey and SRWare Iron. The recovered information can be saved to the disk in the form of a text file, HTML, CSV or XML.
 
 Attention!
 
 Due to the functionality offered by the tool, it can be detected by antivirus software as potentially harmful and threatening our security, but it is in fact completely safe.
 The program installation wizard offers you the option of installing additional components, but you can omit this operation by clicking on the 'Decline' option.
