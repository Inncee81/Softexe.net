This add-on offers the user a set of functions to streamline the download of large (but not limited to) files from the Internet. The most important one should be the division of data into the so-called segments that significantly speed up the download process. Subsequent Turbo Download Manager options are an effective option for pausing / resuming file downloads useful in case of unstable Internet connection, as well as audible notifications, eg about the completion of file downloading.
 
 Turbo Download Manager has been made available for Firefox, Google Chrome and Opera browsers.
