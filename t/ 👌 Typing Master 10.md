Before downloading the application, keep in mind the fact that Typing Master 10 does not offer support for the Polish language. The program includes many useful theoretical lessons and practical classes, during which we will learn, among other things, how to properly hold your fingers over the keyboard, and then check how fast we are able to enter new words.
 
 This is, of course, only an introduction, but after completing the 10-hour course provided by the creators of the Typing Master 10, we will write on the keyboard two, maybe even three times faster (everything really depends on the predisposition of the user). However, it does not change the fact that after using the program, we will save a lot of time, and thus we will become more efficient in everyday work at the computer.
 
 It is worth mentioning that Typing Master 10 adapts to the progress of the person using the tool on a regular basis. So if we do not deal with a given issue, the program will automatically generate additional exercises, thanks to which we will train in this area. In the meantime, we will also be able to play computer games to check what progress we've achieved while learning using Typing Master 10.
 
 Typing Master 10 offers support for various key layouts on the keyboard, such as QWERTY, QWERTZ, AZERTY and more.
