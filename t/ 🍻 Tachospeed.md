> Tachospeed is a software for settling drivers' work time with analogue and digital tachographs, enabling the reading of driving times, rests, breaks and rosters from tachograph charts and driver cards.

The program operates on the basis of drivers' working hours, i.e. Regulation 561/2006 and AETR. Program modules (digital, registration, basic and extended control module, delegations and diets, fuel) enable the processing and analysis of the obtained data in many cross-sections, by generating reports. This allows you to keep a full record of drivers' working time (also for the National Labor Inspectorate), including accounting for overtime, delegations, calculation of fuel consumption, etc.
