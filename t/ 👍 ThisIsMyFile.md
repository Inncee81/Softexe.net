When using the Windows operating system, there are often situations in which we want to delete a given file, but it turns out that it is protected by another person or program. In this situation, we can launch the ThisIsMyFile application that allows you to immediately get rid of selected files.
 
 It is also worth noting that ThisIsMyFile is characterized by the simplicity of use, because it is enough to drag selected files to the program window to start the removal process. 
 
 ThisIsMyFile does not require installation, so we can easily place it on your computer's hard drive or pendrive.
