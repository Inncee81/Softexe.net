Total Recorder Editor is an advanced program for recording any sounds played by a sound card installed in a computer, regardless of whether it is a dedicated card or integrated with a motherboard. In addition to recording, the application also allows basic editing of audio files.

As the authors of the program boast, if the sound passes through the sound card installed in the computer, the Total Recorder Editor will record this sound and allow it to be processed. This means that we can record not only the sounds coming from the microphone, but also currently playing music, podcasts listened to on the network or the sounds of a battle in an online game. Thanks to the rich, but nevertheless logically arranged user interface based on the "ribbon", the program's operation is relatively simple, and the case is facilitated by a graphic editor allowing easy cutting, combining and not only individual fragments of the soundtrack.
 
 With the help of the built-in editor, we can also add some effects to our recordings, such as muting, removing noise, normalizing the volume level, reversing channels, adding silence or delay. Total Recorder Editor supports basically all the most important and most common audio formats, such as MP3, OGG, WAV, AC3, ACC, FLAC and more. The number of available options makes it an interesting proposition even for more advanced users looking for an effective tool for capturing sound and an audio editor in one.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days. Additional limitations include the lack of the possibility of mass conversion of files and recording of recordings.
