> 7+ Taskbar Tweaker (formerly 7 Taskbar Tweaker) is a small tool that allows you to customize the taskbar in Windows 7, 8 and 10. With it, we can easily change user-triggered events, including using the mouse.

The program gives the user the ability to change the system's response to the basic commands issued using the mouse on the taskbar. He can, among others modify events triggered by right-clicking or mouse-clicking on items on the taskbar, dragging an item to the taskbar, hovering over an element with the cursor, etc.
 
 7+ Taskbar Tweaker also allows you to customize the behavior of thumbnails on the taskbar, applications pinned to it, as well as settings for grouping and merge elements. With its help, we force the system to leave free space on the taskbar and hide the 'Show desktop' button. In addition, the Taskbar Inspector module is offered, giving greater control over the grouped elements.
 
 The tool is very simple and what is important, safe to use. Unlike other solutions of this type, it does not make any changes to the system registry. Any changes consist of "injecting" into the Windows system properly crafted DLL libraries.
