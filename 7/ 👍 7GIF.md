In addition to the main function of GIF animation playback, the program also allows you to view each frame saved in the file, change the speed of the played videos or watch the reverse animation. 7GIF also offers the function of saving selected or all frames of a GIF file to one of the six popular graphic formats (PNG, JPEG, BMP, TIF, WMF and GIF), the ability to zoom in and out graphics as well as changing the background color of the window.
 
 7GIF, although it is not an application that is too complex, the options it offers are perfectly suitable for viewing the GIF (Graphics Interchange Format). The program integrates with the Windows system shell and offers the possibility to become the default GIF format browser.
