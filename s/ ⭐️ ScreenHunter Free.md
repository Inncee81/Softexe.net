The options available in the free version of the program are the selection of the area from which the dump will be made (the entire screen, the active window or a manually selected area), the way of saving, including graphics format, file location and naming, and additional settings related to the behavior of the entire application. It is also possible to determine whether the mouse cursor symbol should be visible on the screenshot.
 
 The operation of the program is not complicated, although the manufacturer decided to use a common application interface for its three available versions (there are also paid variants). As a result, in the described - free - edition, most of the functions are unavailable (which is grayed out, but still visible). This may initially make it difficult to find those items that you can use.
