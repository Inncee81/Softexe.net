The software creates a special "protection sphere" in which we can place many popular programs such as web browsers, mail clients, instant messengers or P2P programs - any changes made to the system by monitored applications can be undone. What's more, Sandboxie allows you to impose numerous restrictions on access to the network, drivers, files and other resources in the protected space.
 
 The setup package with the default configuration for several popular applications can be a convenience for less advanced users.
