> SmoothVideo Project is a program that allows you to get a very clear and extremely smooth image in movies. The technology used by this tool has so far been known only to the owners of expensive equipment with appropriate functionalities, but now computer owners can also use it to install this free application.

The program allows you to watch video on a computer using frame interpolation. Under this not much talking concept lies a fairly clever mechanism - it turns out that the SmoothVideo Project generates intermediate frames of animation between those that are already available, thus creating an extremely fluid image. Frame interpolation should be perfectly known to people who run movies whether on high-end PCs or projectors. In the case of this program, a computer with a mid-range processor and almost any graphics card is enough.
 
 SmoothVideo Project works almost in the background - the application appears in the form of the operating system tray icon. By clicking on it with the right mouse button we gain access to various options, thanks to which we can configure the tool according to the needs, specifying even the method of clipping frames or the resolution of the displayed image.
 
 It is worth noting that detailed instruction manual is available on the SmoothVideo Project official website. It also contains other useful information, including a list of supported video players, supported graphics cards and a summary of the answers to frequently asked questions.
