By using SAPPHIRE TriXX, we can monitor the behavior of the GPU on a regular basis, and also turn up the graphics card, if necessary. The application displays detailed information about your system, including its name, number and type of memory, interface type, number of shaders, timing, driver version and more. In addition, the user can find out the frequency and temperature of his GPU and change the speed of the fan.
 
 SAPPHIRE TriXX allows you to save settings in selected games, so you do not have to configure them before each production launch. However, it is worth remembering that the number of custom profiles has been limited to five, but this is not the end, because in SAPPHIRE TriXX we will also find two other modes of operation: high performance and quiet operation.
 
 In the event of any problems, SAPPHIRE TriXX will allow us to save reports to a file, making it easier for us to locate possible defects.
