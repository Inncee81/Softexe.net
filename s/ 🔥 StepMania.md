```sh
StepMania is the most popular free dance game in the world that follows the footsteps of commercial console games cooperating with mats and vending machines. The game is based on rhythmical tapping of directions when the arrows reach from the bottom to the line at the top of the screen. The game is possible alone or with someone, although naturally in the latter case everything takes on much larger blushes.

The community around him is a huge strength of the project. As far as the basic version of the game does not shock the number of songs available to be tapped, on the Internet you can easily find whole large packages of songs prepared by fans, even with music videos in the background. Usually, you do not have to wait for centuries to add newer hits, and all the downloads from the network are free.
 
 
 If StepMania enters someone hard, he will probably look for far-reaching modifications to the title, sometimes completely changing it graphically. With properly prepared songs to dance, you can also sing, because the text is displayed to them. In addition to many modes of play on one computer, there were also network options. We do not necessarily have to fight someone with our PC.
