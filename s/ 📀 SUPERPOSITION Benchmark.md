SUPERPOSITION Benchmark offers two modes of operation: benchmark and game, thanks to which we will check what our GPUs can afford. Before starting the benchmark SUPERPOSITION Benchmark will allow you to determine the image resolution (the range is extremely wide, from 720p up to 8K), as well as selecting DirectX or OpenGL.
 
 In addition to the standard performance test, the SUPERPOSITION Benchmark program allows you to check the graphics layout for games that use virtual reality technology. In this case, we have to choose the most popular VR goggles available on the market, namely HTC Vice and Oculus Rift.
 
 After completing the SUPERPOSITION test, Benchmark will display a detailed report that takes into account the defined parameters as well as presenting the specification of the computer. We will know the number of displayed frames per second (minimum, medium and highest), graphic card temperature and the degree of GPU use during the test.
