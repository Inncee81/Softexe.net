smartUp Gestures is an add-on to the Google Chrome browser that allows you to add mouse gestures to it. The application offers many ready-made operating schemes, which can be freely edited.

The settings interface does not look too modern, but it remains functional and clear. The menu on the left allows you to switch between the most important elements of the option and to properly configure the way you interpret the mouse gestures while browsing the Internet.
 
 By default, you should make gestures while pressing the right mouse button, but the settings also allow you to select the middle button. Thanks to the gestures we will be able to refresh the pages, switch between the cards or even decide how to save the pictures.
