StrokesPlus is a free utility that adds an application management feature to your Windows OS using mouse gestures. The program offers the user both a built-in set of gestures (allowing to minimize, maximize and close windows, switch between running applications, control the media player and much more), and the ability to create your own gestures and edit existing ones. By default, to execute a gesture, you must hold down the right mouse button and perform a certain movement. The program does not require installation.
