> The SteamVR Performance Test is a computer benchmark that will help you know if its components are efficient enough to support Virtual Reality technology. The performance of the processor and graphics card as well as the version of the installed operating system are analyzed.

The whole is based on a 2-minute scene with Aperture Robot Repair - a demo version of the game created by the manufacturer specifically for the promotion of VR technology itself. So you can be sure that the result obtained at the end will reflect the actual efficiency of our equipment, and not based only on a synthetic estimate, although generally the results should be treated only as a general guide - in practice the situation may be different. The test is carried out in a window with a relatively small resolution, in which the actual application is simulated. On the screen are then imitated eyeglass lenses in which the image that is needed for the target display of the game using goggles is rendered.
  
 After the test we will find out what level of performance our equipment has achieved (graphic graphing helps in this). A text summary will also be available, in which we will receive valuable advice on what components we should change to improve performance in VR applications.
  
 Finally, after expanding the additional details, you can check the statistics of the test performed, and learn about the settings at which we should be able to use applications and games that use virtual reality technology in the future. In this case, however, it should be noted that the indications are only estimates and in practice can be quite different. Some applications, despite the theoretical ability to operate smoothly, for example at low settings on our computer, will not allow the use of other preferences than the maximum graphic settings.
 
 Attention!
 
 The program is installed via the Steam platform, therefore it is necessary to have a user account of this service and the installed Steam program .
 The installer's link leads to the website of the service where it is necessary to download the program manually - use the green "Free" button and then inform the installer if we already have the Steam program installed.
