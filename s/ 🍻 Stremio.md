With Stremio, we can organize and follow information on favorite TV series, movies and TV programs and download subtitles. After proper configuration of the tool, the mentioned content can be launched not only on the computer, but also on selected mobile devices.
 
 Stremio also allows you to find a list of available programs, movies and series on the network, which you can filter by category, then add to your own library and evaluate to recommend it to other users. At the same time, the tool allows you to search for new content for viewing based on those that you previously assigned to our account.
 
 Interestingly, after creating a video library in the Stremio program, we can synchronize it with all your devices. The tool supports not only computers, but also other devices. For example, we can run the selected file on a PC and stream the image onto a TV, tablet or smartphone screen.
 
 Stremio is equipped with a modern, very eye-catching graphic interface that uses popular tiles. Thanks to this, we have direct access to all content in a readable form.
