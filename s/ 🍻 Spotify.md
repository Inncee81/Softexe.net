> Spotify is a free application that allows you to play your favorite music shared online within a service with the same name. From its level, we will recreate music collections on the computer, including millions of songs of more and less popular artists.

Undoubtedly, one of the greatest advantages of Spotify is the number of music materials available to the user and simple and intuitive operation of the application itself. Through it, it is possible to play any song at any time, as well as listening to internet broadcasters playing music in the genre we indicate. The user has a built-in search engine, playlist functions and a music collection management mechanism on the local computer drive.
 
 Spotify allows you to recommend songs to your friends that appealed to us. What's more, from the level of the application, we will create our own internet radio and listen to music in our friends' collections. There was also a mechanism for commenting on songs, creating play queues or access to performers' biographies.
 
 Attention!
 
 To use Spotify, free user account registration is required.
