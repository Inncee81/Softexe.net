The application on the background of the competition is distinguished by a carefully crafted and intuitive graphical interface, in which individual options are within reach at every stage of work on the project. The created presentation can include files located on the local hard disk, materials available online, as well as video clips directly from YouTube. The very process of creating a presentation is very simple and is limited to importing materials and then organizing them on the timeline.
 
 Another important feature of SlideDog is the possibility of broadcasting our presentation online. Activating the appropriate option allows us to generate a link and access data for our project in a few seconds, which will be passed on to our viewers to enable them to view the presentation. From the level of the tool we will also create simple surveys to collect opinions about our work.
 
 SlideDog supports the majority of the most popular media formats, graphics and documents. However, working with them is seasoned with certain requirements. For example, if we want to use video files in the system, we need to have a VLC player installed, support for PowerPoint presentations (PPT, PPTX) requires the presence of Microsoft Office, etc.
 
 Attention!
 
 The free version allows you to create multimedia presentations with a maximum length of 15 minutes. If you want to get around this limitation and get additional functionality (including support for 2 monitors), you need to update the paid edition application marked as Pro.
 
 The installation of the program requires an active Internet connection.
