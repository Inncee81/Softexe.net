The application integrates with the Start Menu, but it is also available during the start of "windows" after pressing the F8 button, so you can use it also in the event of a crisis situation. SmartFix Tool deals with suspicious and dangerous files that have not been found by standard antivirus software.
 
 SmartFix Tool offers the option of repairing a computer from the system recovery environment. In this mode, the computer is reset and the problems are resolved. With the help of the described tool, we will eliminate the irregularities noticed while using the network, as well as download additional programs such as: Autoruns, CureIt and AdwCleaner.
 
 It is worth noting that from the official website of the SmartFix Tool manufacturer we can send selected files for analysis and add them to the white or black list. Each such file must have the appropriate extension (jpg, gif, png, 7z, rar, zip, exe, dll, sys, txt, log) and weigh no more than 200 MB.
