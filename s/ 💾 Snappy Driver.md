```sh
Snappy Driver is a small tool designed to manage drivers - thanks to it, we will not only make sure that we have installed software for every component or device installed in the computer, but also easily update older versions of drivers.

A big plus of the application is that it takes up little space (just over 2MB after unpacking) and does not require installation. All you need is to download the packed archive, unpack the program and check the status of the drivers installed in the system. Snappy Driver may and does not belong to exaggerated-looking applications, but nevertheless it is easy to use and even an inexperienced person will be able to handle it, especially since the creator has tried to incorporate many language versions - of course, Polish language could not be missing.
 
 Despite the interface, which is a bit like past times, Snappy Driver has quite a lot of options to manage drivers. We can use the expert panel to decide what to do if newer versions are found, whether the program should take into account missing software for devices or choose one of the available color themes.
