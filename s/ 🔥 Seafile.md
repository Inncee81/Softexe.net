The perfect solution for enterprises
 
 The program was created for corporations and smaller companies. We can use it to put any documents, photos or other materials that will automatically appear on all configured devices in the cloud.
 
 Securing data with a password
 
 Seafile allows you to organize files in the form of libraries and allows you to synchronize them with any computer. Access to files "in the cloud" can be obtained from the local S drive: without synchronization, as a result, we increase our local disk space and can also use it offline. In addition, there is the option of encrypting such a library with a password and encrypting files before synchronizing with the server, which means that even the system administrator can not view such data.
 
 Free, but ...
 
 Seafile Pro Edition is available for free as long as three users use it. Other subscription types are payable. For example, an annual subscription for 9 users is an expense of $ 100 (total). Detailed information on the other price variants can be found on the manufacturer's official website.
