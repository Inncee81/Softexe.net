Seaside Multi Skype Launcher is a very useful application for simultaneously running multiple Skype accounts on one computer.

Sometimes there are situations when you need to open two or more Skype accounts on the same machine. This, for example, happens if the PC is used by several people at the same time, or if you have several registration accounts for different purposes. In a normal situation, one has to either constantly leave Skype or change the computer user, which is very inconvenient.

This small portable utility easily solves this problem, allowing you to run multiple Skype accounts at once. Just enter your username and access password for each account, and they will appear in the general list. Now start Skype - the status for each registration will be displayed in the tray. As usual, double-clicking on the status icon will open the main Skype window with all your notes, messages and conversations. And when a new event appears, you will see a familiar notification on the status icon. In general, everything is quite easy and simple.

In addition to the Skype account, Seaside Multi Skype Launcher allows you to run and an account from Microsoft, but unlike Skype, only one.
