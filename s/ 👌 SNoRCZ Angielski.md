The program is targeted at beginners as well as intermediate-level users who want to "polish up" their English language skills. Learning with this simple application is done using the picture-memorizing method, and the vocabulary available within it has been divided due to difficulty levels and thematic categories.
 
 SNoRCZ English offers several ways to acquire knowledge. It is possible to browse cards with words, corresponding pictures and their example in sentences, as well as entering or selecting words based on displayed graphics. In the main application window you can follow your learning progress. The program on the basis of committed errors offers the user a repetition.
