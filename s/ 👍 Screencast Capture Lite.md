With Screencast Capture Lite, we can prepare various presentations, tutorials or any other video material recorded directly on your computer. The application allows capturing images from the entire desktop, contents of a single window or selected area. The user decides whether the program should also record keyboard and mouse activity.
 
 Screencast Capture Lite allows you to configure several settings, so that we can adapt the program to your own needs. Thanks to the available options, we will determine, among others, the number of frames per second during the recording, the file format (AVI, MKV, M4V, MP4, MOV) and the sound quality (22050 or 44100).
