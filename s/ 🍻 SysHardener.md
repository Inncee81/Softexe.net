The most important function offered by SysHardener is the ability to disable unnecessary options launched by the Windows operating system. The user can also secure individual applications (for example Microsoft Office suite or Acrobat Reader) to reduce the risk of infecting the hard disk with various viruses.
 
 SysHardener also allows you to introduce restrictions to the Microsoft Office office suite (disable macros, OLE and ActiveX), block outgoing connections for selected applications through the Windows firewall, deactivate the ability to run JS, VBE, VBS and WSH scripts, and prevent opening of selected files ( DOC, XLS, VBS, JS, JSE, WSF), by means of which malicious software is spread. 
 
 Importantly, SysHardener allows you to select the most important functions with just one click, so you do not have to define individual program options step by step. This is a good solution for less demanding customers. If necessary (eg when selected applications will work incorrectly), it is possible to restore the default configuration.
