After launch, sWeather is available in the form of an icon in the system tray, through which we are informed about the current outside temperature. When you click it, a small window appears on the screen that already contains a bit more metrological data for a given city. They contain, among others the lowest and highest temperature, data on cloudiness, sensible temperature, barometer, humidity, visibility, sunrise and sunset, as well as geographic data of a given location. Importantly, the application allows defining more than one location for monitoring.
 
 The tool has been made available in a portable form (portable), which does not require installation on a computer. Despite the lack of the Polish language version, it is so easy to use that it should not cause any problems to anyone.
