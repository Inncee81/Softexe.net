The tool is addressed mainly to more demanding players who intend to assign, among other things, selected buttons on the keyboard or mouse to specific activities, change the sensitivity of the device or the color and the way of highlighting for controllers containing this option. 
 
 SteelSeries Engine can boast of many options for customizing settings (including the possibility of creating an unlimited number of user profiles), and at the same time a small amount of operating memory. Therefore, the application does not affect the performance of the computer, which can be crucial in some situations.
 
 It is worth adding that SteelSeries Engine allows you to place your user profiles and other settings "in the cloud" using the SteelSeries CloudSync service. It's the perfect solution for those who often travel and do not want to configure the mouse or keyboard anew.
