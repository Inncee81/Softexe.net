ScanSpeeder is a small but very useful tool that can significantly improve the process of scanning more photos. It allows you to process several photos at the same time using a scanner and save each one to a separate TIFF and / or JPEG file.

The application, despite its small size, offers much greater possibilities than standard software for scanning scanners, which are attached to these devices by manufacturers. It is an indispensable tool useful when archiving to a digital form, eg old family photos. With its help, we will scan several photos simultaneously, and then we will save each of them to a separate file on the disk, thus saving your time.
 
 Among the features offered, we find, among others options of recording comments to photos in the form of tags for graphic files, automatic or manual correction of the orientation and curvature of photographs, appropriate quality (and also size) changes for the purposes of publishing them on social networks or sending e-mails in attachments, as well as direct publication of selected graphics on the Facebook profile.
