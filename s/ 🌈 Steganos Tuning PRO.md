Releasing hard disk space may not only be important for operating the operating environment, but also in a situation where we have less HDD. Steganos Tuning PRO removes temporary files (eg from the recycle bin or web browser), organizes data in the registry, allows you to increase the battery life of your laptop, allows you to manage your media (eg to get rid of unnecessary songs or video), and includes hard disk defragment option. In the event of accidental deletion of the necessary documents, Steganos Tuning PRO will easily offer the option of restoring data.
 
 Steganos Tuning PRO also accelerates Windows startup, optimizing autostart, operation of services offered by the Windows manufacturer, as well as operating system settings. We can also protect your private temporary files shared on the network by completely removing "cookies" and browsing history.
 
 It is worth noting that Steganos Tuning PRO also takes care of driver or application updates, as a result of which our PC also works faster and more efficiently than when using outdated files provided by hardware and software manufacturers.
