The software gives us the ability to clone the full contents of a standard hard disk, and if the capacity of a new SSD is insufficient to accommodate all data, it allows the user to define files that will be included during the migration process. Using Samsung Data Migration we will transfer to the new disk both the operating system, as well as applications and games installed in it, collected media, documents and all kinds of other files. The tool automatically creates a system partition, subsequent volumes can be freely created by the user according to his recognition.
 
 The biggest advantage of the program is its banal service (despite the lack of the Polish language version) and the fact that it allows you to save time, which we would have to spend manually transferring data or installing the system on a new SSD medium. The configuration of the tool is basically limited only to the definition of the input and output disk to which our files will be copied.
