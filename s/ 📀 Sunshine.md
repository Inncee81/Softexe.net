> Sunshine is a fast and secure tool for transferring files between devices, without the intermediation of a cloud. The Windows application allows you to share selected folders for other devices. Sunshine has no limits on the size of uploaded files or their number, and allows you to send files to Facebook friends.

Sunshine can be installed on Android, OS X, iOS and Windows. After connecting devices with one user account, the transfer of files, however, takes place directly, using the peer-to-peer method, both on the local network and via the Internet. The program allows you to choose which folders the applications on mobile devices will have access to, as well as where the backup copies will be saved (requires a Premium account that can be purchased or obtained for free by recommending the application to a friend on Facebook).
 
 Sunshine mobile applications allow you to download files from your computer and also play them remotely. Supported formats include AVI, MP4, MOV, MKV, M4V, WMV, MP3, FLAC, M4A and WAV. Sunshine works flawlessly with the h.264, h.265, x264, xvid, divx, quicktime, ac3, aac, dts and some other codecs.
