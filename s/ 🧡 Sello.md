With the Sello application, you can easily display goods and handle transactions from such auction sites as Allegro.pl and eBay.com (eBay.pl, eBay.de, eBay.co.uk). The program supports the seller at all stages of the auction service: from preparation and issue, through sales tracking, to handling transactions with clients. It helps you track payments, prepare packages and printouts. It has a built-in webmail module and Sello Zone - a web-based communication system with clients. Sello's integration with the market-leading sales system, Subiekt GT, enables efficient and comprehensive service of the company.
 
 Sello also allows you to quickly create a series of letters using templates and automatically generate and send messages to buyers (eg confirmation of receipt of the payment, information on sending the goods, etc.).
