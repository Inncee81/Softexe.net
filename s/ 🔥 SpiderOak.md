The program has a number of features that allow extensive control over stored online files. Unlike the competition, it allows not only to synchronize data, but also to create backup copies of files, monitor the transfer of materials or easily share them with friends. The program interface is divided into 5 tabs, each of which provides separate functions. In the first - Status - we can view the progress of data synchronization, set files in the queue, and read the log files. The Backup tab allows us to select the files that we want to back up. We can choose our own directories or the default ones for Windows - for example, My Documents. SpiderOak also supports selected data formats - movies or music. The next tabs will allow us to preview the synchronized folders,
 
 From the preferences of the program, we can change interface elements (automatic startup when logging in, support for keyboard shortcuts) or individual functions. For example, we can block the copying of files that are too large or older materials stored on the computer. Subsequent changes may concern queues of files, connection to the network or copying of archived data. From the level of the program, you can also edit the account settings, the registration of which is a condition required to use SpiderOak.
