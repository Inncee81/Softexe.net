Syncovery is a program that is used to backup files. Against the background of many other similar tools, it stands out because it also allows you to synchronize data between several devices in real time.

In addition to the ability to perform a standard file backup, Syncovery also includes the function of performing two-way data synchronization (SmartTracking) and allows you to create a copy of the source folder (Extract Mirror). The tool supports FTP, SSH, WebDAV, SSL, Amazon S3, Azure, Google Docs and HTTP.
 
 Syncovery offers the ability to automate backup processes, by using the task scheduler option, which allows you to configure the dates in which the program is to deal with the operation. 
 
 If we do not have adequate knowledge in the field of program operation and backup, Syncovery will find a wizard that will facilitate the data backup, presenting step by step the steps to be taken to successfully complete this operation. 
 
 It is worth noting that the Syncovery authors also care about data security. The program uses encryption technology, thanks to which user files are protected from unauthorized persons.
