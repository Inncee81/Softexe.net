> Solid Edge 2D Drafting is a tool for creating technical documentation in the form of 2D drawings. Basically, it's a dedicated Draft module from the Solid Edge commercial package. It is deprived of the possibility of automatically generating projects from the assumptions. However, it is a fully functional self-contained program for creating 2D drawings. It supports the most popular formats, including dxf and dwg (AutoCAD) or dgn (MicroStation). Solid can be an alternative to a paid AutoCAD LT solution.
