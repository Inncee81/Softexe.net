Surf Anonymous Free is a small and free application for people who value privacy while using the Internet.

The tool allows you to create a fictitious IP address, which makes it impossible to track user activity on the network. To do this, select the "Select Fake Location" button located at the bottom of the interface (in the free edition we only have to choose the United States) - importantly, we can use the "Stop Hide" option at any time to interrupt the program and return to your real IP.
