The program separates the mixed audio files and also allows you to define the appropriate layers, which we can modify with high precision. SpectraLayers can be used for audio mastering as well as for creating and conducting analysis of various sounds.
 
 SpectraLayers Pro is one of the most advanced tools for processing sounds and music. It is characterized by huge editing capabilities, as well as a user-friendly editor, through which we modify audio files. Each sound played in the program is displayed in the form of a graph, which allows obtaining more accurate and legible readings of the most important information and parameters of the sound being processed.  
 
 Using the application, we can divide the files into individual component layers, and then modify them and process them arbitrarily. SpectraLayers Pro also allows you to process signals using available VST plugins and to separate music and dialogues on individual layers. In addition, it also allows you to remove damaged fragments and unnecessary noise, and can perform a full correction on selected elements of audio files.
 
 Attention!
 After the first launch, programs should be registered for free. SpectraLayers Pro is available in a trial version and allows for 15 days of free use. In addition, it has numerous limitations, including no sound recording or exporting.
