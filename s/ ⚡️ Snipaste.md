> Snipaste is a small but functional program for taking screenshots. Against the background of competing proposals, it is distinguished by numerous editing options for casts, including the imposition of notes on them, and even censorship in the form of blurred areas.

The program's operation is similar to most applications of this type. The icon on the toolbar informs us about the operation. We can initiate a new snapshot by clicking on it or using the keyboard shortcut predefined in the options. During the execution of the dump, it is possible to manually select the area of ​​interest or to fit it to the full screen, the window of the active application, or other smaller elements of the system interface.
 
 The program also works with a system clipboard (you can add content to the screenshots) - PNG, JPG, BMP, TGA, ICO, TIFF and GIF formats are supported, as well as some other types of documents, e.g. HTML and TXT. Snipaste also stands out from the competition with a number of settings that allow you to actually tailor the application to your own needs.
 
 Attention!
 The manufacturer has prepared a separate installer for users of Windows XP (available after expanding the All versions section ).
