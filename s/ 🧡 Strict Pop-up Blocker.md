> Strict Pop-up Blocker is a very simple extension for the Firefox browser designed to block all kinds of pop-ups (so-called pop-ups) on visited websites.

The addon described is almost maintenance-free and does not require any configuration from the user. After installing and launching it is available in the upper part of the browser window in the form of a small icon, which when clicked enables / disables blocking of unwanted content. Strict Pop-up Blocker very well deals with blocking of windows with advertisements or information about the use of cookies on the website.
 
 However, this extension has a considerable disadvantage, which will be perceived by more advanced recipients. It is not possible to create any exclusions or lists with websites that are skipped during operation, which often means that it may happen that, for example, harmless content necessary to use the website will be blocked.
