It allows to keep files: serviced cash registers, checkouts, service orders, taxpayers with assigned installation locations, cash registers, service technicians, producers and services (together with a table of contacts), as well as a built-in database of Tax Offices, counties, communes and postal codes. For each serviced cash register, it is possible to view the history of completed orders, inspections carried out, exchanges of fiscal memory, as well as printing all necessary documents for the website and the taxpayer.
