Sushi Browser is a modern web browser. At first glance, we are dealing with another application of this kind, which does not stand out from the competition with anything special, but it is only a semblance.

The aim of the authors of Sushi Browser was to maximize the use of space on the computer screen, which is why the described tool allows you to display web sites, bookmarks and more, in various panels. Thanks to them, we can simultaneously browse more than one website, at the same time having a quick access to Google search engine, and - for example - source code.
 
 Sushi Browser allows you to manually open further panels in places indicated by the user, and also allows you to use the synchronized scrolling function. The option of taking screen shots from the whole website (and not just the part visible on the screen!), Which can be stored on the clipboard or saved to a file in JPG or PNG format, is also very interesting.
 
 The application has been additionally equipped with Adblock, the function of downloading files, the ability to perform gestures with the mouse, a quick search of data in the browsing history, as well as synchronizing the contents of the history and a list of bookmarks between multiple computers.
