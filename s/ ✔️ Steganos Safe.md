> Steganos Safe is a professional security software package, thanks to which we will be able to create a virtual disk where we store confidential documents or multimedia.

Steganos Safe makes use of modern, 384-bit AES-XES encryption with NI-Hardware acceleration, thanks to which we guarantee that our files will not be intercepted by unauthorized users (eg hackers). Encryption covers both portable media and files stored in the cloud (Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive and MagentaCLOUD).
 
 A special assistant checks, however, whether data is protected on media containing backups (support for USB, CD, DVD, Blu-Ray discs). It is worth mentioning that the tool manufacturer has many years of experience in creating data protection programs.
 
 Although the tool seems to be addressed mainly to large corporations and smaller companies, it can be successfully used also at home, as it has a very intuitive and easy-to-use interface. 
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
