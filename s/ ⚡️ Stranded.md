> Stranded is a simulator of life on a desert island. After the sinking of the ship on the unknown waters of the Atlantic you manage to reach the land as one of the whole crew. You are exhausted, hungry, thirsty, and true heat is pouring from the sky. You leave the water and head deep into the island ...

The beginnings turn out to be really difficult. The only thing you can find is blueberries and some grains. During the escape from the ubiquitous lions you get to a spring with fresh water. Then you eat some berries, you gain a bit of strength, but suddenly it gets dark and there are problems continuation - you have to look for shelter as soon as possible. Once this is done, the period of darkness can be used for a dream that will regenerate the body, but be alert and do not fall asleep in the water!
 
 If you managed to experience the first day of your stay on the island, then everything should be somehow arranged, but you can not stop searching. Wandering around the island one gets the impression that it circulates aimlessly, exposing itself only to a predator attack, but it is not. In addition to the aforementioned berries and grain (which are the easiest to hit), you should use the "search" option to collect everything that stands in our way.
 
 Such things include: stones, insects, leaves, lianas, wood, tools, etc. By combining the appropriate objects (eg grain + stone = flour) we can receive further semi-finished products, with which we can make final products such as bread, which you will be able to trade with one of the natives. This fact is very important, because a resident of the island in exchange for food reveals the secrets of survival on the island. 
 
 The next step is to build a hut, start a fire, hunt for animals, etc. All this with the help of previously produced tools. Perhaps an individual of the opposite sex will be found on the island ...
 
 Stranded does not knock a graphic design. There are not too many sounds, not counting those related to the island itself, i.e. "jungle sounds." At first the game does not encourage, but after a while really draws in, and sometimes it is even funny and funny, even the appearance of lions :-D. Despite this, I recommend the game to everyone, aha and one more thing, the term "uninhabited" island is only conventional ;-).
