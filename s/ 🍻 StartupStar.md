The program is easy to use and displays all applications that are automatically launched when you turn on your computer. On the main screen there is a special menu containing the most important source locations (Win.ini initialization file, system registry and start menu directory), in which we can find all entries, files and other elements related to the respective application. 
 
 
 StartupStar displays a detailed list of all active applications. Thanks to this, we can easily identify unnecessary software that unnecessarily runs with the Windows operating system. In this way, you can speed up computer startup and remove all unwanted applications that interfere with normal system operation. 
 
 
 Users using this small software can easily add or delete applications and modify existing programs. StartupStar not only removes unwanted applications, but also completely blocks them preventing their subsequent launch. In addition, it allows you to create and restore backups of all actions performed in the program. 
 Attention!
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 60 days.
