The advantage of the tool against the background of competitive solutions is its high efficiency and speed of action. In addition to simple operations involving the recovery of unintentionally deleted media or documents, the program also allows you to restore invisible partitions and logical drives.

 Working with the program is very simple and does not require additional knowledge or skills. After starting, the user indicates the drive on which the lost data was located. The tool then proceeds to processing the header data (MFT / FAT) of the previously indicated locations. After completing this process in the built-in file manager, it is possible to browse the content of the previously selected disk. There are visible both files currently on the media, as well as those deleted for various reasons. A great help at this stage is a tool for filtering files, allowing you to efficiently manage the type of data presented. In order to restore the data, simply click on the Recover button in the main menu and select the location where the recovered data will be saved.Attention!
 The trial version allows you to recover a maximum of 3 files with a total size not exceeding 1 GB. To get rid of this restriction, you must purchase a license for the program in the corresponding variant. More information on this topic can be found on the manufacturer's website .
