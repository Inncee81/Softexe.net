> Slack is a very powerful communicator prepared for small and medium-sized enterprises, whose members work together remotely using the Internet.

Before starting to use, the administrator must create a group and then invite selected people to it. Thanks to this, all members will get access to the same messages and opportunities, which will allow them to communicate with ease. Slack has a built-in chat that allows you to have text conversations with any group member. In addition to sending messages, we can also share selected files with drag and drop.
 
 Channels are also an interesting feature. Slack divides them into two groups: open and closed. In the first, you can share content with all users (eg general messages for employees), while the second one is intended for people who deal with specific projects (it is worth using them when you do not want various files and messages to fall into the hands of unauthorized users).
 
 Slack is available directly in the web browser, but the program can also be run thanks to a dedicated application, installing it on a computer (PC, Mac, Linux) or a mobile device with Android, iOS or Windows Phone. Interestingly, you do not have to gradually turn on the program to stay up to date - just activate the notifications on your desktop; when a new message appears, we will immediately receive relevant information.
 
 It is worth noting that Slack provides the search engine. It is useful mainly when we use the tool for a long time and we want to find an entry for example from a few months ago, even years.
