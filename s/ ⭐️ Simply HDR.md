> Simply HDR is a brilliant in its simplicity and very effective graphics application for creating and processing photos in the currently very popular HDR (High Dynamic Range) technique. Thanks to the use of sophisticated algorithms, it allows you to process almost any image into an image with an extended tonal range.

The program is very easy to use and is directed to users who, with minimal effort, without having specialized knowledge in the field of graphics and through just a few clicks of the mouse would like to create spectacular HDR images based on selected photos. The main window of PhotoArtista Sketch apart from the preview (in real time) of the effects of our work includes a set of dozens of HDR styles, among which we find ones that successfully transform almost every photo into an image with an extended tonal range, reminding what actually can be seen by the human eye. The tool, of course, gives you the ability to manipulate individual attributes of each style, as well as to create your own profiles with configurations.
 
 Among the many advantages of this program, one should also mention its price, which is currently only USD 7.99. PhotoArtista Sketch is available in the version for Windows and Mac OS, as well as for iPhone and iPad.
 
 Attention!
 The demo version of the application offers the user full functionality, but does not give the possibility to save the converted image.
