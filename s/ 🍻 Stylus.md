Stylus is an extension to browsers, with which it is possible to modify the appearance of websites. The program updates cascading style sheets (CSS) on a regular basis and displays the website in the way the user wants.

You can create new styles yourself or download ready-made proposals from the Internet. The Stylus application is based on the original version of the popular Stylish extension, which has recently disappeared from stores with browser add-ons.
 
 Stylus is an easy-to-use addition if you plan to build on ready themes downloaded from the Web. Then all you need to do is download the appropriate theme and upload it to the application. However, if you plan to create your own sets of colors, you need to be familiar with the CSS and HTML syntax and have a lot of jam and some free time.
 
 attention
 The program download link leads to the Google Chorme version. By developing the All versions list, you can also download the edition for Firefox and Opera browser.
