In addition to the list of available options in the left part of the interface, we will also find here quite accurate descriptions of each of the functions that are displayed after selecting the command we are interested in. Unfortunately, at this moment it is not possible to modify the basic syntax (parameter changes).
 
 At the moment, the program includes, among others, the following commands:
 
 
 Disk cleanup utility - a quick shortcut to the disk cleanup tool, in practice an application cleanmgr.exethat will allow you to remove unnecessary files from the system,
 Remove SP uninstall data - a tool that allows you to delete files related to service packs, to release even more than 1 GB of disk space (it is only useful for systems older than Windows 8),
 Analyze - will allow you to check if the Component Store needs cleaning,
 Cleanup - the component will be cleaned, which should release several gigabytes of disk space,
 Cleanup + Reset Base - cleaning will be additionally accompanied by restarting the database (this will prevent the installation of service packs and Windows Update updates),
 Health Check - basic check of the computer to inform about possible problems to be solved,
 Health Scan - advanced scanning for correctness of the component,
 OEM drivers repository - allows you to remove device drivers from OEM repositories,
 Sign. Verification - the disable option will disable , and enable - will enable verification of signatures when installing new drivers,
 Boot Menu - as in the above case, disable will disable , and enable - will enable the display of the boot menu (in Windows 8 and older it will affect the F8 key when booting the system),
 User Accounts - shortcut to the system tool netplwiz.exe.
