> Professional Screenshots is an extensive and very advanced program, by means of which we capture the contents of the desktop or window of the selected application, and then the captured material will be edited before recording in one of many available formats.

The application has a large number of profiles built in, which are sufficient for most typical applications of the program. We will find among them options that allow you to capture screenshots as the entire visible screen content or cut out using geometric figures, an automatic profile that automatically adjusts the area according to a given object or display only a contextual menu. Added to this is the ability to record video with sound.
 
 The number of possibilities is really big and it can initially get dizzy, especially compared to other applications of this type. If that's not enough, we can edit every profile or create our own rules. Added to this is the possibility of a simple editing of captured graphics, adding effects and conversion to one of the selected formats. The captured materials can be saved either as graphics or even documents of the MS Office package, PDF - there is also nothing to prevent the screen from being directly copied to the clipboard, sending an e-mail as an attachment or printing directly from the application.
 
 The only serious complaint about Screeny Professional is the installation process in German and the fairly dubious quality of other language versions - on English it is often possible to meet dates in German.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
