After running, the program runs in the background and its icon is in the system tray. Just right-click on it and select "Show profiles" from the drop-down list, then "file" and "new profile" to define the Second Copy settings according to your preferences. It is worth noting that after defining them, the application runs in the background without any interference from the user.
 
 The creators have prepared two wizards - express and advanced. Using them, we specify the files or folders that we want to back up, as well as the backup destination (eg hard drive, external memory or a computer connected to the network). Second Copy allows you to create a backup at any time - we can determine if this operation is performed every two hours, or, for example, once a week.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
