Thanks to Sharepod, we can easily copy not only songs, but also movies, podcasts, and many other, any content, transferring them from the aforementioned Apple mobile devices to the computer of this manufacturer or PC with the Windows operating system. It is necessary to have iTunes installed.
 
 Sharepod also allows you to recover music from your iPhone, iPod or iPad with one click. This option is especially useful when you want to access your tracks after a computer breakdown or when you intend to use a freshly purchased PC, and do not have a hard drive from the previous device.
 
 An interesting feature of Sharepod is also the ability to copy and share playlists created previously by the user. You can copy any playlist from any iPhone, iPod or iPad to the selected computer via iTunes.
