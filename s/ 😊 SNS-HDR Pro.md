SNS-HDR Pro is equipped with a user-friendly graphical interface, allowing the user to fully shape the created HDR image. Unlike other programs of this type, all complicated calculations regarding HDR image generation are made after starting the program - just after loading the photo file. On the one hand, this allows for later viewing of parameter changes in real time, but on the other hand, it can annoy the long time of initial calculations.
 
 In addition, SNS-HDR Pro has an automatic image alignment function (offset compensation, scale, rotation and perspective), also allowing batch processing, which significantly speeds up the processing of large quantities of files.Attention!
 
 The author provides the SNS-HDR tool also in the free Lite version , which can not be used for commercial purposes.
