SpyShelter Firewall is a program developed in Poland, which in its main opinion is to protect the user against threats such as all kinds of reading programs, loggers, eg keys pressed on the keyboard, contents of the system clipboard or current screen contents.

The application provides protection against keyloggers, screenloggers, reading the contents of the system clipboard, as well as unauthorized use of the built-in webcam or microphone. SpyShelter also has an encryption mode for typing data on the keyboard to increase protection. The program is based on white and black lists, by default allows trusted applications signed digitally. One of the most important functions is the restricted applications mode, in which selected programs can only write to the places specified by the user, without access to others. A very interesting option is the system protection module and the system kernel. Thanks to it, SpyShelter is able to behave in part like traditional HIPS, ie monitor the behavior of other applications affecting the operation of the system, registry and drivers. Thanks to this, it is able to protect not only against loggers, but also against many other types of malware depending on their behavior and the methods used. In total, SpyShelter monitors nearly 60 different shares.
 
 The Firewall edition is enriched with a firewall module implemented via the TDI or WFP driver (newer Windows systems). The firewall is based on the rules created when initiating traffic and displaying the appropriate alert, in which the user decides on the action taken. Additionally, it is possible to define network zones based on the network adapters used in the computer.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 14 days.
