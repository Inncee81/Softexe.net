> Super Blue Boy Planet is a small, very nice and easy-to-learn 2D platformer maintained in the atmosphere of games from around three decades ago ;-). The square characters in the pixelated, colorless graphics and simple plot immediately restore memories of old times. The title also puts more on the skill than thinking, which allows you to focus entirely on breaking your fingers on the cursors. And only cursors.

The player's main task is to save his beloved aliens. Therefore, there is a lot of jumping on platforms, avoiding dangerous bullets, spikes and other ambushes. There will also be a fight with various opponents and, of course, fights with bosses.
 
 The key to success is the proper use of the ability to fly over dangerous territories and objects. To do this, bounce on the correct height and hold down the key for a sufficiently long time. Not without significance is also the sense of time and the optimal moment to run between descending enemy foes.
 
 In Super Blue Boy Planet, the game is nice, it's a nice time game. However, it will require a lot of dexterity and patience for repeated repetitions of some parts of the game.
 
 Attention!
 
 In order to install the game, you should download the Steam program - a special internet platform that allows you not only to buy and download computer games, but also to offer players the opportunity to contact each other, exchange experiences and play together.
