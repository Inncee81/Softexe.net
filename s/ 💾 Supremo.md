Supremo is a tool for remote control of another computer, which will be a good helper for network administration, providing online technical support, displaying your screen to other users, etc. The application does not require installation in the system and is immediately ready for use. You do not need to configure the firewall or router.

After starting the program, you will be assigned an ID and a password. By sharing this data with another Supremo user, you will allow him to access control of his PC. If the opposite is necessary (you must connect to a remote PC), then you must enter its ID and password, respectively. Conveniently, you can organize a kind of address book of users and distribute them into groups, which greatly simplifies the search for the right client in the future.

Of the additional features of the program is worth noting:


file transfer as with ordinary file manager
encryption of all sent data using AES 256-bit algorithm
randomly generated 4-digit password for each session
creation of conferences with participation of several users (in the paid version)
fully customizable account and other utility
