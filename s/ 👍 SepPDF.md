Thanks to the described tool, we can extract all pages from PDFs to save them in separate files or to cut out any part of the document, specifying the range of pages. In this way, we will transfer, for example, covers from one big document to individual files.
 
 SepPDF is characterized by a clear, minimalistic interface as well as simplicity of use. Just specify the source file and then choose one of the two available options.
