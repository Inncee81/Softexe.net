Soft Organizer is a powerful application manager that allows you to install programs with tracking, completely remove them if necessary (completely clearing all remnants after them), and also reports on the availability of new versions of programs installed on your computer. It has a high speed, due to the fact that when tracking changes made by the installation programs, the changes on the disks are analyzed in real time, without resorting to long-term preservation of information about all files before and after installation.

Using the change tracking feature during installation, you can safely safely remove the application along with any leftovers that usually remain on computers during normal uninstallation. In addition, there is a trace search function for applications that have not been installed with tracking. 

The difference between Reg Organizer and Soft Organizer is in the function of checking new versions of installed programs. Otherwise, Reg Organizer contains all the features of Soft Organizer.
