The tool itself is virtually maintenance-free. It's enough to register a free user account, connect the computer with it, configure the application on the portable device and enjoy the view of our desktop on a smatphone or tablet. Splashtop allows you to work with remote files and use applications installed on the Mac or PC on the tablet screen. The producer boasts that thanks to the use of advanced image transfer technologies, you can even watch movies and play - up to 30 frames per second will be displayed on your tablet or smartphone. In addition, the tool allows you to stream music from a computer and can also be used while conducting a presentation, as long as we move within the same network. 
 
 The quality of the image displayed on the mobile device depends on the speed of connection to the Internet. The free version of Personal allows you to connect remotely only between devices located within the same network. If you want to bypass this limitation, you should purchase a paid subscription that will allow us to use the 3G modem (if one has a 3G modem) built into the mobile device for connection.
