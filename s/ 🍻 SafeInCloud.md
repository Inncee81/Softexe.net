The program can be downloaded for free, but it is worth remembering that the number of its functions will depend on whether we have decided to pay for the full version of the SafeInCloud application for Android or iOS . One of the functions available only in the Premium version is m.in. data synchronization between devices and operating systems. That's why what a desktop program will do on Windows will depend to a large extent on whether we buy access to the full version of the service.
 Using the SafeInCloud program on Windows, we can mainly manage our passwords, PIN codes and other important data that we entrusted to the service. You can group information, add labels to them, and organize them. The program also includes a password generator that allows you to assign them to a specific service, for example to Facebook or to a Google account. The program also allows you to configure the synchronization of our data with the selected cloud, e.g. Dropbox or Google Drive. The data is secured using 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard encryption.
