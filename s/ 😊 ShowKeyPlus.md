The program is distributed in a portable form (not requiring installation), and its operation is very simple and requires no specialist knowledge. After its launch, a small window is displayed on the screen with basic data on your operating environment - including the product key required during installation. 
 
 ShowKeyPlus allows the user to also recover the key on the basis of information stored in the system backup. The program allows you to export all collected data to a text file.
