> Speedtest for Desktop is an application of one of the most popular Internet connection speed tests for the Modern Windows interface. The program checks both the delay and the speed of downloading and sending data.

The service is practically no different from its more well-known web and mobile counterparts. Also here, just use the large Start button to start a new test. The application automatically selects a stable and possibly close server for us based on the location (GPS or IP-based), but if necessary, you can also select it manually. 
 
 The whole test does not last longer than about half a minute. The results are presented in a clear form, and using the additional panel you can view their history. Interestingly, unlike the mobile applications of the program, it is not possible to select a data presentation unit here.
