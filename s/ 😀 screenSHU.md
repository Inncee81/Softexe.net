The program allows you to freely create screenshots of the entire screen or the area indicated by us, e.g. windows of any application. Right after the creation of the screen it is automatically sent to external servers, so we can easily share it with friends (link to the image is available at the top of the window) or publish in the form of an entry on Facebook and Twitter. The process of saving graphics in a computing cloud, as the developers of the tool say, takes less than a second.
 
 In the hands of the user of the screenSHU program, there is also a set of tools for basic processing of the created screenshot. When using them, we will apply a blur effect to the screenshots, draw important elements, draw any shape, add text, arrows or such geometric shapes as circle, circle, rectangle or lines. The tool works well when creating graphics that can be part of multimedia presentations, training, etc.
