The application allows you to easily slow down or speed up almost any video material in a simple way. slowmoVideo supports a large number of formats thanks to the ffmpeg library, which is necessary to use the program. To make the slowmo effect more realistic, the program also offers the function of generating the motion blur effect. When creating slow motion effect from video clips with a relatively low frame rate, the application tries to predict in which direction the pixels move and on the basis of the collected data to create non-existent frames using the algorithms.
 
 slowmoVideo works with any graphics cards that support. Entering the release and acceleration effects of the video clip is done by manipulating the curves on the timeline.Attention!
 
 
 For proper operation the slowmoVideo application requires downloading the ffmpeg tool compiled by Zeranoe (32-bit Builds (Static)). After unpacking the package, copy the ffmpeg.exe file from the bin directory and place it in the root folder of the slowmoVideo program.
