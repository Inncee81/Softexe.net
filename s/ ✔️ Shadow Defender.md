The program was created to protect the computer against harmful components such as imitating antivirus software, which in the hidden and without the user's knowledge introduces unwanted modifications in the system, enabling, among others, stealing data, etc. Shadow Defender gives us the ability to run the operating system in a virtual environment. Shadow Mode, because this is the name, allows you to redirect any change in the system to a virtualized environment that is not in any way related to the real operating system. Such a solution in the case of detecting any undesired actions allows the user to restart the computer and return to the operating environment intact.
 
 The tool is an excellent solution for people who often run files of unknown origin. The Shadow Mode offered ensures that even if we are dealing with a malicious component, it will not make changes to the Windows system, and our data stored on the disk will remain unaffected.
 
 Attention!
 Crack to the program is available in our section PROGRAMS -&gt; Extras -&gt; Polish locations (see: Related Programs).
