The tool is ideal when you need to, for example, track the behavior of customers in the store or look after the order on the construction site. It is very important that the Security Eye allows you to view images from up to 64 cameras at the same time, and also offers the ability to record images (on a regular basis or in accordance with a fixed schedule), so that we can register the most important events that took place at home, office or any other place.
  
 The Security Eye contains many useful options, including a motion detector. If an activity is detected, the program automatically takes a snapshot or creates a short video, and the user can receive notifications about the presence of an intruder via e-mail or SMS.
  
 The described program is extremely easy to use, because it automatically scans the network and defines the IP address of the camera, the manufacturer's name and the model of the device. After doing this, the Security Eye is ready for action, so it does not require specialized knowledge and can be used by less experienced recipients.
