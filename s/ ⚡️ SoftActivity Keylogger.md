With the help of this easy-to-use program, we check what operations are performed on the computer by kids or colleagues during our absence. The tool can record information about each started application, its working time, the history of websites visited, e-mails sent / received, instant messaging conversations, and even characters entered using the keyboard.
 
 There was also a mechanism for creating screenshots, generating complex activity reports and sending them to the indicated e-mail address. SoftActivity Keylogger also allows you to record all operations performed on files and monitor network and removable drives connected to your computer. Importantly, the tool works in the background, information about processes related to it is not displayed in the Windows task manager, and access to configuration options is protected by a password (defined during installation).
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 3 days.
