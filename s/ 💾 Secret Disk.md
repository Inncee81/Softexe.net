> Secret Disk is a basic and free edition of an interesting tool for effective protection of valuable data stored on our computer. It provides the ability to quickly hide and protect private documents, photos, video materials, etc., so that they are not visible to other computer users.

During its operation, the program creates a special virtual disk that functions as a safe. The user can add to it any data (files and folders) of various sizes. Access to this disk is possible only after entering the password correctly (the so-called PIN) defined during the first launch of the tool. Otherwise, the data is invisible, making it impossible to reach any files stored in our safe. Importantly, work with virtual disks takes place in the same way as in the case of standard volumes.
 
 Secret Disk is an excellent proposition for novice users who would like to secure their files quickly and conveniently. Even such situations as a system or hardware failure will not give unauthorized persons access to our private data - shutting down / restarting the computer automatically closes our safe.
 
 Attention!
 
 The program requires the .NET Framework version 3.5 or later installed in the system. The latest version of the .NET Framework can be downloaded in the section PROGRAMS -&gt; Add-ons -&gt; Libraries and other add-ons (see: Related Programs).
