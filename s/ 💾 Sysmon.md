Sysmon is a system utility for monitoring all processes in the Windows operating system. The tool is small and is controlled from the command line. After installing this service, it will conduct a constant analysis of all processes passed through the system, recording information from log files.

The utility is designed, perhaps, for experienced users who at least know how to use services from the command line. If the tool is properly configured, you can get valuable and useful information about the state of the operating system, as well as additionally find malicious or suspicious processes by calculating possible vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers.

Main features of Sysmon:


Record process events with all parameters.
Write hashes of saved files to SHA1 (default), MD5, SHA256 or IMPHASH.
Specifying GUIDs for processes and events in the logs so that they can always be quickly found and connected to each other.
Logging data about the loading of drivers and libraries with their digital signatures and hashes.
Logging network connections.
Definition of the fact of forced change of the file creation date and display of the true file creation date.
Automatic configuration reload when registry changes.
Logging when the operating system boots to record the activity of malware that has entered the kernel.
