SAM DJ is a powerful tool for mixing tracks that works under the control of the Windows operating system.

According to what the name of the program suggests, it was created for DJs who received a number of the most useful options. SAM DJ offers the ability to automatically assign and manage a database of up to 50,000 songs, allows you to record voice announcements that will be played during the performance, as well as a range of sound mixing options. We find here primarily an equalizer, a 5-band audio processing engine, and a 2-band audio equalizer.
 
 The SAM DJ interface is quite complicated, because we are dealing with a tool directed to professionals, but its creators did everything to make the program as intuitive and user-friendly as possible. That's why the drag-and-drop function was implemented, as well as the presence of the history of the files being played, thanks to which we will not include the same song twice in one event.
 
 The individual GUI elements visible on the screen are fully configurable, so we can customize the look of the SAM DJ to suit your needs by removing unnecessary objects. The program also includes three desktops, between which you can switch freely to gain quick access to the necessary options.
