The available servers include: SkyBlock, Classic, PvP Guns, SkyWars, Creative, SkyFire, JumpPVP, WaterBlock, Prison, Chowany, Duel 1vs1, Build, Mini Games and SkyGrid.
 
 Skyland Launcher supports Minecraft version 1.8, so if you decide to play with the program described, you will not get access to the content provided by Mojang studio in newer releases.
