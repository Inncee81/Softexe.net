During the play, we explore a fully-automated agricultural planet, where we initially had to look after the robots that live in it. The space ship that our hero (or heroine) traveled accidently, but fortunately the protagonist escaped with his life. The problem is that the machines that were supposed to be dealt with were simply crazy in the world and are not willing to cooperate. The character we lead now begins a dramatic struggle for survival - this is the outline of the Scrap Mechanic, which will ultimately offer two modes: creative and survival (only the first of these is currently available).
 
 Mechanic contains over 100 building parts, thanks to which we can design transforming vehicles, houses on wheels and many other, various constructions. It only depends on us whether we will carry out individual projects ourselves, or we will invite other players from around the world to play. The game is focused on the multiplayer game, but nothing prevents you from trying your hand alone.
 
 For now, Scrap Mechanic does not require clashes with encountered opponents, but it focuses entirely on unhampered construction. Production rewards the creativity of the player who can create various objects using the available elements. Before we go through this, however, we should familiarize ourselves with the mechanic's manual, where many tips are available.
 
 Attention!
 
 Scrap Mechanic is in the Instant Access phase on Steam. This means that work on the game is still ongoing, and during the game you can find various errors. Developers have not yet implemented all functions (they will be added successively in subsequent updates).
