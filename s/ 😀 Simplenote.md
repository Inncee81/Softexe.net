Simplenote is a minimalist, open service for storing and synchronizing notes between devices. The client for Windows allows you to create and edit them, as well as cataloging and searching.

Simplenote for Windows has greater possibilities of editing notes than its counterparts for other platforms. A markdown document formatting system has been implemented here that can be turned on for each note separately. Thanks to it, you can create more complex texts according to the WYSIWYM philosophy. 
 
 
 A characteristic feature of Simplenote is the ability to review changes in the time of each note, and if necessary, also to restore the older version of the text. You can edit notes on all your computers, share them publicly or send them via email. 
 
 
 In program settings you can change the skin to dark. In the Windows client, a label system was also implemented to keep order.
