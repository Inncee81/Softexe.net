It is a game not just any, because it was created by Hi-Rez Studios, known for such network shooters as Tribes: Ascend or Global Agenda . The title combines not only the elements of the action game and strategy, but also largely refers to the arcade aspects.
 
 The gameplay focuses on skirmishes between teams built of players incorporated into ancient deities. The fights take place on symmetrical, in short small maps, on which teams competing with various types of heroes with individual abilities, features and unique powers join the rivalry.
 
 The teams fight for dominance each time trying to get to the opponent's base as soon as possible and win the final battle with Minotaur. Before this happens, however, we will have to go through a mandatory tutorial. It is worth noting that the game offers a very extensive Practice mode, in which less experienced players, preferably before proceeding to the main game, can learn all the battle lines and face the computer opponents.
 
 In the game you can also use a special store, where for the gold you gain useful items, increase power, physical strength and improve your defensive abilities. The cost of specific boosters depends on their power and suitability. The authors have not forgotten about the micropayment system ;-), but using them in the case of Smite does not play such a significant role as in the case of other productions.
 
 Smite is an energetic and very addictive position. The possibility of competing with other players, interesting scenery, dynamism of clashes, a number of available modes, excellent audiovisual setting and a high degree of playability, additionally conquered with the arcade aspect, are just some of the strengths of this title.
