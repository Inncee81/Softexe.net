Within the main program window, the user gets access to information about the CPU and RAM usage, the degree of hard disk full capacity as well as the speed of transfer within it and the speed of connection with the Network. From the SysGauge settings we can freely configure the data displayed by the program. There was also a possibility to save the collected data in the form of reports on the local disk.
 
 Importantly, the tool offers functions of alerting the user about exceeding the critical operating parameters for the selected computer component. In addition to sound notification, SysGauge also allows you to send relevant e-mails.
