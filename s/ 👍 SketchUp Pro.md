The tool, despite its enormous possibilities, remains simple and intuitive to use. With its help, we will quickly and efficiently create object models from scratch, as well as modify those, for example, downloaded from the Internet. Its functionality has already been appreciated by hundreds of thousands of users around the world - designers, architects, etc. Another advantage of SketchUp is support for plugins, allowing you to enrich and personalize the program's capabilities to suit your individual preferences.
 
 The latest version of the software allows you to import files DXF, DWG, 3DS, DAE, KMZ, TIF, JPG, PNG and many more. In turn, ready-made projects will be saved to PDF, OBJ, FBX, XSI, VRML, MP4, WEBM and AVI formats.
 
 The program can be tested for 30 days. Unfortunately, the trial version is only available in English. License holders can download the Polish version from the distributor's website .
