The basis of SecureAPlus is a real-time computer security module that scans the system's content in search of pests. It allows you to efficiently detect all kinds of infections, supporting documents created using the Microsoft Office office suite, PDF files or compressed ZIP archives. As a complement, designed to raise the level of protection, a mechanism called Application Whitelisting is offered, whose task is to prevent the launch of a suspicious executable, program or game. It enables effective protection of the system against potentially malicious components, identifying and allowing only trusted applications to be launched.
 
 The program also has an on-demand scanner function that allows users to analyze user-defined locations at the time set by the user, as well as a quarantine option in which potentially dangerous files can be placed. SecureAPlus can be used in conjunction with standard anti-virus software without causing collisions and computer performance.
 
 Attention!
 
 As part of the free version, the manufacturer offers the user a one-year software license.
