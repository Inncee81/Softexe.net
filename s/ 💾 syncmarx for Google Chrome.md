When creating Syncmarx, the author was guided by the key criteria that Xmarks met. The extension must be free, sync unlimited bookmarks and automatically, use the native bookmarks collection in the browser, and synchronize data between Chrome and Firefox. The extension does not have its own servers, and the user's Dropbox account serves as the mediator in the synchronization. After installing the extension in the selected browser, you need to associate it with your Dropbox, and an encrypted file containing a list of bookmarks will be saved on the virtual disk.
 
 In the settings you will not find many options, which in the case of this extension is an advantage. We can set the frequency of bookmarks synchronization and prepare different profiles and, if necessary, "download" a specific set of tabs to the browser. After adding or removing the item, the tree in the browser will be compared with the tree in the file and based on the timestamps, the "current" version of the bookmark collection will be determined. You can also force downloading tabs from a specific profile at any time - then all tabs in the menu will be overwritten with those from Dropbox.
