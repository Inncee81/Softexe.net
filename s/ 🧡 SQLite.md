It has been developed continuously since 2000 and enables creation of SQL databases without the need to start the server. It is based on ordinary files saved and read from the local hard disk. Such a file stores the entire database structure, including tables, indexes, views or triggers, and can be easily transferred between different types of platforms. The contents of the SQLite database can collect information up to 140 TB in size, and the library itself provides ACID transactions and implements most of the SQL 92 standard.
 
 Many popular applications for Windows are based on SQLite. Thanks to the offered option it works perfectly in embedded systems, as well as various types of desktop programs, mobile or web applications. Developers provide precompiled editing for the most popular operating environments. SQLite offers programming interfaces (APIs) for ActionScript, Perl, PHP, Ruby, C ++, Delphi, Python, Java, Tcl, Visual Basic, .NET and others.
 
 SQLite offers support for the ODBC interface.
