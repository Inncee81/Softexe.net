This program can completely replace the standard means of copying the Windows OS, and, in addition, it has a number of useful properties, such as displaying the speed and time of data transfer, limiting the transmission speed and others.

Also, SuperCopier can create and process lists of files to copy and automatically rename them. In addition to all, the utility supports data downloading after connection failures.

The main features of the program:


pause and resume moving files;
control and calculation of copying speed;
detailed display of copying progress;
edit the copy list;
error log;
saving and loading a copy list.
