A simulator of the construction of a medieval castle - this is the shortest description of the production made by FireFly Studios, originally released in 2001. In the Stronghold HD game, which appeared 11 years after the premiere of the original, we will have to complete an extensive campaign with 21 missions, during which we join the fight for medieval England to deal with hordes of cruel Wolf. Multiplayer is also available for adventurers, allowing simultaneous play of up to eight players.
 
 During the Stronghold HD game, we need to extract raw materials, build more buildings, and recruit units to attack other castles. In addition to the standard play mode, the game also offers an economic campaign requiring the collection of specific objects and the creation of weapons (without the need to fight against opponents). The task is not simple because we have limited time for it.
 
 Stronghold HD offers a refined graphic design, as well as features not available in the edition from many years ago. We mainly talk about the possibility of zooming in and out of the camera, thanks to which we can see as many details as possible or have full insight into the battlefield to plan further actions.
