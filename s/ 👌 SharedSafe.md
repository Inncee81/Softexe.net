The program integrates with the Windows system shell and is available from the context menu. With its help, we can easily and conveniently encrypt all valuable and confidential data that could fall into the wrong hands. SharedSafe is based on the AES-256 algorithm and enables the protection of any type of files stored locally or on FTP servers and in the so-called the cloud. Encryption operations always take place on the client's side.
 
 The free version allows the application to be used for non-commercial purposes. In addition, it is possible to link only one folder from the program level. If you want to get around these restrictions, you should buy one of the paid plans .
