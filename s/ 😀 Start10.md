Start10 is another implementation of the Start menu, adapted for the latest Windows 10 operating system. Microsoft, on numerous requests from users, returned to Windows 10 its familiar and easy-to-use Start menu, but this integrated menu combines a kind of symbiosis from the classic Windows view. 7 and tiles from Windows 8, which does not suit everyone. In this case, you should pay attention to the application Start10.

The developers of this shell implemented several visual menu styles: the familiar Windows 7, modern design (Modern Style) and the new Windows 10 itself. It supports file and application search, PC settings are available, power management is organized, programs can be launched from the Windows Store and much more.

If you don’t like any of the suggested styles or just want to make some visual changes, then an editor is provided for this, where you can optimize the finished style or create your own from scratch.

The undoubted advantage of Start10 is its complete customization "for yourself": several Start menu icons are available, you can specify the display of required program shortcuts and folders, adjust transparency, turn on the highlighting of new programs, use the user's avatar and much more. It is also worth noting that Start10 perfectly “gets on” with the system menu built into the “ten”, which allows you to work with them in parallel (for example, one menu is controlled by a mouse, the other is a keyboard).

In general, Start10 is a very interesting application that will allow you to return to your Windows 10 operating system the familiar and favorite "Start" menu with all its advantages.
