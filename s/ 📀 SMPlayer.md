The program copes very well with the playback of almost all available audio / video formats without the need to install additional codecs or filters (AVI, MKV, OGM, MPEG, VOB, ASF, MOV, WMV, MP3, OGG, etc.). SMPlayer also plays DVDs and Internet streams equally well. A lot of emphasis in the program was imposed on displaying subtitles for movies. Many formats are supported, including SRT, SUB, SSA, subtitles embedded in Matroska files, DVD subtitles and much more. The text can be freely enlarged, its color or font changed.
 
 One of the most interesting functions of SMPlayer is the option of remembering all the settings of the files being played, when the playback is stopped, the size of the font in the movie, etc.
