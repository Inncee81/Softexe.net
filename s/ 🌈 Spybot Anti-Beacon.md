The main difference between other applications of this type, and Spybot Anti-Beacon is that this particular program has been adapted also to protect the privacy of users also in older operating systems of Microsoft - this applies to Windows 7 and Windows 8. This allows any user of these systems can disable all or part of the system functions related to tracking, gathering information and sending them to the servers.
 
 Spybot Anti-Beacon is very simple to use, the program from the first launch informs about detected "gates" and modules that collect our data, while the main bar at the top of the application window in percent indicates the general level of security. The user can either simply click the Immunize button, which will disable all detected modules, or become familiar with advanced options - these are basically just a few additional information and the ability to disable only selected elements.
