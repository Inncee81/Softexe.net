```sh
SoundSwitch is a small application that allows you to quickly and easily switch between different audio sources on your computer.

The program uses the default keyboard shortcut CTRL + ALT + F11, which allows you to perform the mentioned operation. SoundSwitch proves to be a useful tool in a situation where we simultaneously have a monitor with speakers, and we also connected a TV set and stationary speakers to the computer.
 
 Without the use of the described application, we can also change the sound source, but this is related to the change of settings in the Control Panel every time, which is much more time-consuming than using the solution proposed by the authors of SoundSwitch.
