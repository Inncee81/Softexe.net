Thanks to this relatively small and simple application it becomes possible to controlling a mobile device from a computer. Without any major problems, we can make voice calls or reply to SMS messages without using physical contact with the device, using the mouse and keyboard connected to the computer. The user is informed about all incoming calls and texts via the on-screen window.
 
 Another useful feature of SideSync is convenient and fast file exchange between portable devices and the computer. It is enough that the user with the help of the "drag-and-drop" method will transfer selected data. This option allows you to conveniently add attachments to text messages located on your computer disk or enrich, for example, text documents with photos from your smartphone.
 
 SideSync software is available for Windows and Mac OS. Its operation is very simple and is limited to the installation of the application on the computer and mobile device, and then the combination of both devices (USB cable or WiFi network). Current edition SideSync supports smartphones with Android 4.0 or newer and tablets with Android 5.0 or newer.
