> SnipSnip is a program for capturing images, among other things, from computer games or various applications. The tool allows you to capture an image or its designated part, but its possibilities do not stop there. SnipSnip contains a built-in mini-editor of graphic files, through which we can, for example, resize our screenshot or cut to the desired location.
