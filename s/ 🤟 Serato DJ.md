Unlike many other applications of this type, the appearance of the program is more like a more complex audio player than applications for mixing music. This impression is not without a reason, because the most part of the application window is music manager / video clips and sources from CD / DVD media along with the music library view, broken down by song name, artist, bpm, album title and track length with any comments .
 
 Serato DJ requires you to have the right controller, mixer or other compatible DJ device to really start using the application. After connecting them, we gain access to standard functions related to looping song fragments, mixing, marking or adding additional sound effects. At any time, we can also enable the recording function to be able to show off your work among your friends.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 14 days.
