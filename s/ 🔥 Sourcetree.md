The tool offers a simple and intuitive graphical interface that significantly simplifies the management of repositories by visualizing them. It can be successfully used with small, amateur programming tasks, as well as those more extensive, commercial projects. In the case of the latter, the function of reviewing changes, saving work in the clipboard or selection is worth noting.
 
 Sourcetree allows you to visualize the code, support both Git and Mercurial repositories, as well as enter and reject changes at the file, fragment or code level. Thanks to it, it is possible to track the progress of work of teams through branch diagrams and to search and clone remote repositories from the application level. Noteworthy is also the mechanism of dependent modules, facilitating the management of major projects, subsidiaries and project groups.
