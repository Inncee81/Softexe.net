> Sothink SWF Quicker is a tool designed to create web applications using Flash technology. The program can be used, among others, to create games, slide shows, Flash movies, animations, buttons and banners. The Sothink SWF Quicker includes a number of basic tools that you can use to create vector graphics in WYSIWYG (What You See is What You Get) mode. Another advantage of this tool is a built-in animation system that can be used on any elements. In addition, the application has a built-in ActionScript editor responsible for controlling the animation with functions such as highlighting the text or autocompleting the code. The program also allows you to import and edit executable SWF files.
