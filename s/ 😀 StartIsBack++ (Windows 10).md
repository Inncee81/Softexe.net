> StartIsBack ++ is a small tool designed for Windows 10, with the help of which we will restore the desired Start menu for many users. This program restores the Start button on the taskbar along with all the tools and functions available from its level, like the Start menu known from Windows 7 for example.

StartIsBack ++, in contrast to competitive solutions, works quickly, does not consume significant parts of system resources and can be run in a system without administrator rights. The program offers almost identical functionality of the Start menu being created, which is known from previous editions of Windows. It improves the use of the latest Microsoft system, giving easy and quick access to many useful and often used tools and functions of the operating environment, as well as the software installed in it.
 
 The advantage of this simple but very useful tool is the large number of configuration options available, allowing you to customize the appearance and behavior of the Start menu being created. With their help, we will change the number of items displayed in the list of recently used programs, modify the default operations performed by the power off button of the computer or hide selected menu items.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
 The StartIsBack edition for Windows 8 and StartIsBack + for Windows 8.1 are also available for download on the portal .
