For 32-bit editions of Windows, the kernel is also protected. Individual modules can be deactivated in the program settings (however, it is not recommended).
 
 The tool's operation is based on the mechanism of creating black and white lists. In the event of any suspicious activity being detected, SpyShelter displays an alert and the user must decide whether to block or allow the action. The list of rules created in this way can be conveniently managed from the program level. It is possible to add and delete entries and to export or import them from a text file. The list also includes files or folders. Importantly, access to the tool can be password protected against other users of the computer.
 
 Please note that SpyShelter is not a typical anti-virus software and should only be used as a supplement. The program's advantages include low system requirements, as well as the lack of the need to update the reference databases and high effectiveness in identifying yet unknown threats.Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 14 days.
