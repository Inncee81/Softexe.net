Subtitle Mechanic is a small, portable application that allows you to synchronize subtitles in formats (SRT) SubRip or MicroDVD with a movie.

Using the program is extremely simple. The whole operation is limited to choosing a file (or files) after pressing the File button in the main window of the tool. Subtitle Mechanic also supports the drag-and-drop technique with which we can place selected videos in the application.
  
 Subtitle Mechanic offers the ability to synchronize subtitles with millisecond accuracy, but this is not the end of its function. It allows you to automatically save files, create backups, define frame rates per second, and also support multi-language text encoding.
