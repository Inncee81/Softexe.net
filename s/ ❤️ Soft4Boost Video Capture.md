It would seem that carrying out these operations will cause problems for less experienced users, but the producer of Soft4Boost Video Capture has made sure that anyone interested can handle the tool.

 Soft4Boost Video Capture allows you to rip selected material as a whole, and also allows you to divide the film into several parts. The user can choose whether he wants to divide it due to the duration (eg hour fragments) or the size of the file (eg 700 MB to be written on a CD).
