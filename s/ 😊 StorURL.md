The program is characterized by the simplicity of use. After starting the application, we only need to create a new database (which can be password protected) in the selected destination path. It is worth noting that there is an option to create a backup, which may be useful during hard disk failure.
  
 Importantly, StorURL allows you to import all bookmarks from Google Chrome, Opera, Firefox and Internet Explorer. Noteworthy is also the fact that any web site stored in the memory of this application can be launched by clicking the address - you do not need to copy it to the address bar of the browser.
  
 StorURL allows you to split your bookmarks into categories, so when we have a large number of favorite web addresses, we can easily sort them. In this situation, a search engine will also be useful, which also did not run out in the described application.
