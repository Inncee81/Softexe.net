> The various simulators will always be in the center of attention of independent game developers. Stilt Fella proudly represents the genre, allowing us to play someone who moves on stilts. Although many probably guessed that this art is not the easiest one, only this interesting project lets you appreciate the circus performers. Suddenly, an inconspicuous hole in the path of passage goes up to a precipice.

We direct the character with the help of keyboard and mouse. The former is responsible for tilting forward and backward, as well as raising the left or right leg. The mouse from the railways is responsible for the appropriate setting of the stilt. All this together should be neatly combined, because it will be difficult to get up from too wide a leg apart, and if we forget to pull straight ahead, we will simply fall backwards.
 
 
 Each subsequent level is a more difficult arrangement. Numerous hollows, moving footbridges, setting up makeshift bridges, avoiding falling things from the sky or jumping into the water. Otherwise, you'll also look at the routine going down the stairs ... The fun is really difficult, but satisfying. Fall means starting the whole stage from scratch, no checkpoints are planned along the way.
