SugarSync File Manager is a small and multi-platform SugarSync client application that allows you to synchronize and share data with other users via the Internet.

The tool in conjunction with the aforementioned service is an excellent alternative to the currently popular Dropbox. It significantly facilitates data transfer to external servers, subsequent synchronization of data with any computer and sharing them with friends, and what is important allows you to work with each folder on the disk, and the service itself has no restrictions on the size of data transmitted. SugarSync File Manager supports proxies and also provides the option of defining data transfer rates so as not to interfere with other programs using the internet connection. Data transfer is carried out using the TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol and they are stored in an encrypted form (using the 128-bit AES algorithm).
 
 An important advantage of SugarSync File Manager is simple operation. The application is available for Windows and Mac OS, but you can manage your account in the service from an Android smartphone , a mobile edition of Windows , Symbian , iPhone , iPad or BlackBerry device , and even a Microsoft Outlook e-mail client . Data synchronization can take place with any computer that will connect to the account in the SugarSync service.
 
 From the level of SugarSync File Manager, we gain access to several folders that we can not find in competing solutions. The basic catalog is Magic Briefcase, in which all sent data is stored and to be synchronized. Shared Folders contains two subfolders: Shared With Me and Owned By Me, where the directory lists provided to us by others and those shared by us are listed appropriately. On the other hand, Mobile Photos is a location where you can send (if we allow it) automatically photos taken with a phone with the SugarSync application, the Web Archive, where you get data backups and Deleted Files to store deleted files.
 
 Attention!
 
 Currently, the manufacturer does not provide a free tariff plan (free 5 GB of disk space), so the application can be used by users who previously registered their free accounts or decide to purchase one of the offered tariff plans.
