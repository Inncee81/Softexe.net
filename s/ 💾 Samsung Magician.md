```sh
Samsung Magician is an application designed for diagnostics and control of Samsung SSD drives. Thanks to it, the user can check the status of his disk, perform necessary optimizations, and use hardware data encryption. The application is not necessary for operation, but it allows you to increase the performance of the medium.

The main application screen shows all the most important information about the disks as well as their status. We will get to know SMART diagnostic readings, the number of used and free space, the number of recorded data on NAND cells, as well as data on the mode of operation, eg AHCI. From the level of the Samsung application it is possible to update the firmware, i.e. the internal disk software. The program itself checks its timeliness and, if necessary, downloads the necessary data. The tab dedicated to performance tests allows you to perform the analysis of how the read and write transfers look like, as well as the IOPS parameters relative to the factory values. Data is saved, so the user can perform tests periodically or in different load variants and occupied space, which allows him to compare the results.
 
 In the case of systems that do not support the TRIM command (eg Windows XP) from the level of the application, you can enforce disk optimization, ie the appropriate distribution of the load on memory cells. The security tab allows you to use hardware encryption. The disks can be supported in total by three of its methods: class 0, ie through the ATA and OPAL passwords, via the TPM hardware module, as well as the Encrypted Drive function for Windows 8 and later, which allows using the BitLocker eDrive mechanism. One of the available tabs allows you to check the correctness of system settings. Depending on our preferences, SSDs may require different settings, for example to extend their strength or achieve maximum performance. Magican allows you to quickly turn off some functions such as Windows Search services and prior storage. Thanks to the application, the user can also control the hibernation setting and the size of the swap file.
 
 The application also allows you to activate the RAPID mode. It allows you to cache data stored on the disk, which in turn should increase the speed of operation, especially in situations when we use many applications at the same time. Magician also allows you to perform a Secure Erase operation, ie complete erase of data from the media. It can be carried out both from the application level and from the special carrier that we create with it. The program is available for free, does not have a version in Polish.
