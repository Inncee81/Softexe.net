The tool has been equipped with all the options necessary to start the said activity. SHOUTcast DNAS allows you to stream the songs and voice of the given program via SHOUTcast 2.0. In addition, we can share metadata with your listeners so that they can see album covers and individual song names.
 
 SHOUTcast DNAS needs to have its own server for operation. You do not have to worry that any information to your account will be intercepted, because in the application you must define not one but two passwords: securing access to the administration panel and streaming.  
 
 SHOUTcast DNAS has a very minimalistic web interface, which means that a web browser is enough to handle various parameters of your own station.
