> SOS Online Backup is an advanced application designed to perform backups (so-called backups) of our data on a specially designed cloud for this purpose, which not only protects our data, but also allows you to access them anytime and anywhere.

After the installation process, the program should be pre-configured and an account should be created to which all protected files will be assigned. At this stage, we can also choose more advanced options, but remember that they are paid. After creating the account and selecting the software version, we can proceed to selecting the folders to be synchronized. By default, the program selects to scan all folders, only the logged in user's personal folders and the option to manually specify directories.
 
 SOS Online Backup allows for proper configuration of performed backups, offering a preview of scan results, the possibility of excluding the indicated type of files or files smaller than a specified value, or setting automatic backups at a specific time of the day, week or month. Added to this are detailed reports, including those sent via e-mail. If necessary, the software also allows you to restore data from the cloud to the hard disk, which is helped by the built-in wizard.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version of the application allows you to make backup copies of data with a total size of 50 GB.
