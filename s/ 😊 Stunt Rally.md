This position is a treat not only for amateurs of fast driving, but also lovers of total madness behind the wheel, because the authors of the project put a lot of emphasis on realism and driving physics.
 
 Each of the 10 available models of cars, being at the same time a reflection of those from reality, is carried out differently and behaves differently depending on road conditions, weather conditions and its own individual driving parameters.
 
 We can choose from over 80 highly diversified routes. We can chase both in the winter experiencing all the inconveniences associated with this season as well as in the summer on asphalt, sand, gravel or forest ground. I must admit that the creators of the project went a step further by preparing a few totally crazy tracks, on which, in addition to the emotions associated with the competition, we experience extreme impressions from driving on twisted roads in all possible directions.
 
 A multitude of routes, car models, a rich camera system, the ability to record your best times and the most interesting moments from the game, extensive configuration options and many other advantages of this title will certainly encourage not only fans of racing games to play.
