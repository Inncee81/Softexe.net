```sh
Slic3r is one of the best programs for converting a 3D model into a file to be printed on a 3D printer. The program can prepare code for RepRap printers (Prusa Mendel, MendelMax, Huxley, Tantillus and others), Ultimaker, Makerbot, Lulzbot AO-100, TAZ, MakerGear M2, Rostock, Mach3, Bukobot and many more. The program can be used with a graphical user interface or command line.

The program allows you to choose parameters such as the diameter of the extruder outlet, filament diameter, platform size and temperature, extruder working temperature range for a given filament. After loading the model, you can scale it, set several models on the platform, divide them and fix many problems that can occur in the grid. Many of them will be corrected automatically. 
 
 
 In the settings, you can change the way of filling solids, stand and stand parameters, print speed and parameters for printers with several extruders. 
 
 
 The model will be divided into layers to be printed. Each of them can be viewed separately in a special view. 
 
 
 The model can be exported in STL format or as G-code (code for the machine). You can also save layers as vector shapes in SVG format.
