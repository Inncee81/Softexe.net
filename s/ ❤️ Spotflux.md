The program is fully maintenance-free and protects your computer when connected to the network, eg in public places. It is ready for use right after installation and can be found in the system tray (so-called tray). During its operation it can satisfy itself with a minimal batch of system resources, it does not slow down the work of the system, and does not interfere with everyday work with the computer.
 
 In addition to the encryption and security function of the Internet connection, the tool constantly scans all incoming data to the computer, thus protecting it from threats such as viruses, malware and other malware. Unlike other security software, Spotflux does not restrict Internet access in any way, does not block websites, etc.
 
 Importantly, the program can also block "intrusive" and stealing advertising data of the user, thus saving bandwidth Internet connection, hiding the IP address of the computer and blurring information about our location.
