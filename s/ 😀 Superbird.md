> Superbird is a free web browser, characterized by extremely fast and trouble-free operation. The manufacturer of this program also took care of the security of the user surfing the web and the stability of the application.

Interestingly, Superbird is based on the open source code of another browser, Google Chrome (which is why the interface of both tools is very similar to each other), but unlike it, the program does not send any information to Google, such as a list of visited websites. An important feature is the ability to install various extensions, among which we find a variety of themes and plugins.
 
 Superbird, like Google Chrome and many other popular web browsers, such as Opera, Firefox and Internet Explorer, is completely free. The installation of this program runs very smoothly.
