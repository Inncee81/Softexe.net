```sh
sniptool is a small but very useful application for taking screenshots in JPG or PNG formats.
```

After starting the tool, we have to choose whether we want to make a screenshot of regular or irregular shape. Another - and the last step - is to select the area on the operating system desktop or in the running application. After doing this, a screen shot created by us will appear in the main sniptool window.
 
 sniptool contains additional tools thanks to which we can modify the image by drawing various shapes into it, adding text, applying the effect of pixelosis or blurring.
