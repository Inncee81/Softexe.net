> Subsurface is an extensive program for monitoring diving expeditions based on files generated by specialized computers. The application allows you to import logs from measuring devices and websites for divers, and then present data from a specific trip in the form of numerous tables, maps, charts and summaries. It is also possible to create plans for new expeditions and export them to external files.

The program interface is extensive and presents a lot of information at the same time. Most of them will probably be understood only by specialists and people who are already somewhat associated with diving. Unfortunately, the manufacturer does not provide the sample log files with the application to be able to learn how to arrange the elements in the views. In order to check how the interface with specific data presents itself, we must have our own file from a dive computer or start planning a new trip.
 
 With each compilation, Subsurface is expanded with new options. The database of computers with the files the editor works with is quickly extended. The current list of supported devices is available on the producer's website . The program is developed under an open-source license, and the founder of the project is Linus Torvalds himself - the creator of the Linux system.
