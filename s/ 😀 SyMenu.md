SyMenu is a utility that allows you to quickly launch portable programs that are installed on a USB flash drive. There is a special field for searching for the necessary program, which is similar to the search menu in Windows 7. In addition, this tool can automatically link any application on the PC to itself. You can customize SyMenu to quickly and easily add links to portable programs, documents, Windows commands, folders, and URLs.

The main functionality of the program:


Convenient search, allowing you to quickly find any applications.
Using the Windows Start Menu shell, you can search for programs by bundles in the computer host on the Start menu.
The extension manager allows you to replace temporary files with normal Windows extensions.
The autorun feature allows you to launch your own list of applications when you open the utility.
Execution modes: run, run as, open folder and show properties.
Batch mode, allowing you to create a massive import of new applications.
