> Shotcut is a free, open source application for non-linear video editing. The program allows you to quickly and easily edit clips, add special effects or render the final movie.

The editor functions on a slightly different basis than the tools available on the market have accustomed us to. First of all, the application does not offer something like the time line on which we place video materials. In Shotcut we find a playlist of clips with defined time segments for rendering. Before adding a clip to the list of rendered materials, the user can apply several of the offered effects and filters.
 
 Among the filters offered by the Shotcut editor, we find tools responsible for sharpening and blurring the image, improving white balance, adding a glow effect, cropping or giving a climatic look thanks to the plug-in correction and color modification in video (color grading).
 
 In addition, the application offers a large database of defined video compression settings for the most popular formats including h.264, MPEG-4, Apple ProRess, WebM, Flash or a sequence of image files (BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, SVG, TGA, TIFF, DPX) . In addition to video rendering, Shotcut also allows you to stream clips via the UDP protocol.
