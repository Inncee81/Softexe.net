While working on a document, we can not only add, delete and move text, but also change the font size and color. If we have a comprehensive document, we can compress it to reduce its weight (a useful solution for users who intend to send a file via email).
 
 Sade PDF Desktop allows you to divide your document into several parts or combine multiple PDFs into one document. The application allows you to convert PDF to Word, Excel or even a graphic file. This option also works the other way, so if we have a given project in JPG, DOC or XLS format, then with the help of the described tool, we will convert it to a PDF.
 
 We will secure saved documents in PDF in many ways. We can add protection against editing and copying, put a watermark on subsequent pages of the file or protect it with a password.
