Particularly noteworthy in the case of Steganos Privacy Suite deserves the possibility of creating virtual safes, in which we store valuable files, such as company documents, important photos or video materials. To protect all data contained in the safe, password should be password protected (the application allows you to generate passwords extremely difficult to break). Importantly, the safe is automatically "closed" after logging out of the Windows operating system or when it goes into sleep mode.
 
 Steganos Privacy Suite also includes a built-in password manager, thanks to which we store all logins and passwords for websites (eg bank accounts or e-mail). Therefore, each time you log in to a selected website, we will not have to enter this information, because the application integrates directly with the most popular browsers. Thanks to the described tool, we securely store PINs for payment cards, we will also send encrypted messages and more.
 
 If you want to permanently get rid of unnecessary files, you can also use Steganos Privacy Suite, which offers the possibility of performing such an operation.
