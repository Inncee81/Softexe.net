The program allows you to arrange space in one room (living room, dining room, kitchen, bathroom, etc.), the whole apartment or house with garden. Thanks to it, we can see how our apartment will look after renovation, applying paint on walls in subsequent rooms, as well as placing selected furniture and accessories in them. The one who has already repeatedly dealt with renovation or interior decoration from scratch, is well aware how useful the SituHome type tools are.
 
 The aim of the SituHome program authors was to create a simple interface (there is also a drag-and-drop technique available), which even less experienced users can manage. It is also worth adding that they can share their projects with other people, giving them a unique ID of their work, as well as posting them on Facebook, Twitter, Google+ or Instagram.
 
 SituHome allows not only to generate a project in three dimensions, but also includes a 2D view, thanks to which we can see how our rooms look like in such a plan. In addition, it is possible to "walk around" the house, which we arranged using the described tool.
 
 Attention!
 
 You must create a free user account before using the program.
