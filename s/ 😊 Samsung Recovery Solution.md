Thanks to the Samsung Recovery Solution, we can create a data back-up by copying the entire hard disk or only user data, as well as restore necessary files that we have lost as a result of confusion, hardware failure, the presence of malware and more. 
 
 There is also an option to restore the device to the factory state (you can also create a media with such settings). Such a solution offered by Samsung Recovery Solution turns out to be useful, for example, when we intend to sell a used laptop.
