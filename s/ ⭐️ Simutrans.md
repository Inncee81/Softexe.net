We play as a transport tycoon that must take care of the city's infrastructure by building roads, establishing transport routes and purchasing buses, trains or planes to service individual metering channels. 
 
 We decide where and where and what is to be transported. Depending on whether it is about people, raw materials for factories or products, we care about transport as well as ensuring continuous sales. Our actions affect not only the enrichment but also the development of cities and the entire region. 
 
 The project, which was initially developed hobbyistically by one man, after many years has hit the dynamically developing community of fans and thanks to them you can try your hand at many different sceneries - downloadable for the game are packages with cities shown in a typically comic, futuristic way metropolis and vehicles or objects stylized in English, German or Japanese.
 
 The game has a lot of options allowing home transporters to set it virtually completely under themselves, but also for novice players, with the default options set, will allow you to spend a lot of nice moments when setting up stops or building airports. The whole is complemented by the network mode, in which we care about the bandwidth of our distribution channels together with players on the Internet or local network.
 
 Attention!
 
 In order to install, you must first download a special downloader from the project website that allows correct and full installation of the game.
