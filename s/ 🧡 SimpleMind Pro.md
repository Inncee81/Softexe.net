> SimpleMind is a tool for creating so-called maps of thoughts, that is special drawings and slogans, thanks to which we will quickly assimilate the issues visible on the screen. This technique is particularly often used by students during learning before an important test.

After launching SimpleMind, we see a default mind map, which we can freely modify by adding or removing selected clouds, changing their content, size or font color. Numerous graphic styles allow you to customize the appearance of the mind map to your preferences. We find here not only effective but also minimalistic templates.
 
 SimpleMind allows you to design a mind map consisting of texts only, but nothing prevents you from enriching the project, including images or icons, which make the whole look much more attractive. It is worth adding that the program allows you to define keyboard shortcuts. Using them will certainly accelerate the creation of subsequent mind maps.
 
 We will save and transfer the thoughts map designed in SimpleMind to other people, for example via e-mail. The supported file formats are: SMMX (SimpleMind Mind Map), PDF, PNG, SVG, HTML, TXT, OPML and MM.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
