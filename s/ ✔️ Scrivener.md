The Scrivener program is an ideal solution not only for ordinary users, but also for professional writers, novelists, scriptwriters or editors. Using the application, we can fully concentrate on composing and creating a structure of extensive documents, articles, scenarios or novels.
 
 The software offers full control over the formatting of any text, and also has a very useful Corkboard tool, on which you can add and hang various notes, photos and other information to help later in the project. In its resources we will also find additional elements and markers necessary to describe individual objects and other events occurring in a given scene or chapter.
 
 Scrivener will also allow you to keep order while writing long articles. For this purpose, it is worth using the available tools that allow you to format the text, bullet and mark the selected fragment with an additional comment or entry. Behind the application, we can create a transcript of an interview or conversation, as well as prepare a manuscript or write a book. In addition, it allows you to export the created project to any text format - DOC, PDF, HTML or RTF.
 Attention!
 The Scrivener program is available as a trial version and allows 30 days of free testing
