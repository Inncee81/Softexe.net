> Soldat is a phenomenal Polish game that quickly gained popularity around the world. Released in the old-fashioned shareware model, in fact in the full version, but with the possibility of paying for additional options, it quickly attracted the attention of those brought up on Scorched Earth, Worms or Counter-Strike. It is their successful mix in 2D, enriched with some interesting ideas of their own.

We deal with the gameplay in rather standard, as for online matches, modes, including deathmatch or CTF, but the action is seen from the side, not the eyes of the characters. Fun is possible with bots, or computer controlled by enemies, or a live opponent. The arsenal of weapons available is a two-dimensional transformation of deadly destruction tools known from many commercial shooters.
 
 
 Navigating the fancy maps, which we get a lot in the package, make it easier to jet shoes, in total replacing the jump. They use self-healing fuel after a while, so they do not guarantee a constant advantage on the battlefield. It is simply easier to escape from the situation when one enemy massively eliminates everyone on his way and surprise him with an attack from a different side. Some arenas allow the use of boosters.
