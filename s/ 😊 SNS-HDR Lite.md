The program allows you to generate images with a wide tonal range and to process graphics saved in the RAW format without the user's participation. Working with the tool is extremely simple and is limited to dragging photos onto the program icon. The user has no influence on the quality of the generated images. SNS-HDR Lite automatically optimizes graphics by calling a special algorithm that works well enough that the image created on the basis of the default settings is in most cases of satisfactory good quality.Attention!
 In addition to the free Lite version, extensive Pro and Home editions are also available . In the case of the latter, the author excludes the use of the program for commercial purposes.
 The program requires .NET Framework libraries installed in version 3.0 or newer. The latest version of the .NET Framework can be downloaded in the section PROGRAMS -&gt; Add-ons -&gt; Libraries and other add-ons (see: Related Programs).
