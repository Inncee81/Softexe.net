PXE (short for Preboot Execution Environment) is an IT solution that enables convenient installation or launch of an operating system from another computer. In the case of the original workstation, it is not required to have data stores that can store the operating environment that is loaded from the LAN. In the equipment of such a computer, however, a network card must appear that can handle the connection to the server (via DHCP and TFTP protocols) and download the operating system.
 
 Serva is an excellent tool that will enable, among others Windows installation without having installation media such as CD / DVDs, external USB drives (eg pendrives), etc. It allows to significantly speed up the installation process or to install the same system on many computers at the same time. The advantage of this tool is a relatively simple configuration and support for automated installations.
 
 Attention!
 
 Examples of the use of tools along with information about the configuration is presented in a post on the blog of one of our readers.
