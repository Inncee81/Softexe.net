The application scans several system locations and if it detects modified shortcuts, it automatically deletes them. Shortcut Cleaner generates a log file named sc-cleaner.txt on the desktop after the hard drive cleaning process. It contains all information about shortcuts that have been detected and removed.
 
 The tool is used to clean shortcuts substituted by such domains as search.certified-toolbar.com, widdit.com, searchcompletion.com, complitly.com, newhometab.com, dtinstaller.com, chipinstaller.com, homebase-apps.com, helperbar .com and 22find.com.
