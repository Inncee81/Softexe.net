```sh
SmartGit is a Git client that supports GitHub, Bitbucket and Atlasian Stash. Nothing, however, prevents the use of people cooperating with other suppliers or operating on their own servers from using the tool.

The program does not require any configuration, so after starting, we can immediately use it. We will find, among others, a command line, the option to compare indicated files, access to the SSH client, the function of combining selected projects into one whole, and the ability to customize the appearance of the application to your own preferences (eg changing the layout of selected windows or toolbars).
 
 SmartGit can boast of a very intuitive, transparent user interface. It also allows you to choose one of two graphic motifs. By default, we can use clear, but in the program options we choose a dark layout.
