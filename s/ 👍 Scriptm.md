> Scriptm is an application that will reduce the size of JavaScript files (JS) and cascading style sheets (CSS) without loss of content. The operation consists in deleting all white characters from the documents, ie spaces, tabs and newline symbols, which makes the file illegible to the programmer, but remains fully understandable for the machine, taking up significantly less space on the disk or server ( the effectiveness of the application can be up to 50%).

Easy operation will make the whole process enjoyable, which will not be a time-consuming step when uploading a new version of the website to the server. To use the conversion, it is necessary to indicate the JS and CSS files on the disk (just drag them to the workspace), then you can start the minimization process. You can also use the settings in which you can specify the behavior of the algorithm that minimizes files in certain situations, for example when you encounter comments in the code.
 
 A convenient addition is a tab in which the user can write the code and observe its minimization almost on a regular basis. In the case of JavaScript it is also possible to reverse the process and create properly formatted code from the minimized form.
