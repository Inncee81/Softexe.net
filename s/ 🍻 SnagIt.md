SnagIt - the main purpose of the program is to take screenshots from the monitor screen, and it can not only take static graphic "snapshots" of the selected area, but also, for example, record what is happening on the screen in video, as well as capture a picture from applications using Direct X, DirectDraw and Direct 3D.

The built-in annotation editor allows you to add a description to the screenshot, to underline something, to insert, if necessary, the right place, for example, an arrow, etc. In addition, the program allows you to "pull out" the text from where it does not move with the help of Copy / Paste commands.

Of the additional features: support for working with scanners and digital cameras, as well as the ability to automatically send screenshots of the program to the website. And many other little things: managing hot keys, the ability to use presets, pulling icons and other graphics from EXE and DLL, taking a screenshot from a web page that requires scrolling to view and much more.
