SlideShow YouTube resembles Stages and works just as well when editing movies and preparing presentations with animations. The huge advantage of the program is a rich collection of effects, which can be easily used when creating movies. 
 
 
 Graphic, audio and video files can be used to create presentations. The program allows for precise synchronization of various types of materials on an infinite number of paths. When creating, we have high quality dynamic subtitles that can be matched to the content. The visual effects library contains over 100 templates. Most of them can be combined and modified. When applying effects, you can use masking to act only on selected parts of the image. Designing camera movements allows you to attract viewers' attention to important parts of the presentation. 
 
 
 When placing objects in the frame, you can use the grid system to which the elements of the presentation will be attracted and aligned. Smooth zooming of the frame allows you to look at the details, and the paths of moving objects or cameras can be created simply by dragging the mouse. You can also control animations at the level of each frame, not only on key frames.
 
 Projects can be saved in your own program format, and you can export ready to YouTube. 
 
 The manufacturer's offer also includes more extended versions of this program, allowing to export files also outside the popular video service.
