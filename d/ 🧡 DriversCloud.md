DriversCloud is a tool to detect the base components of our computer and software installed on the hard disk. It also serves as a program that allows searching for recommended drivers for particular systems or applications.

It is worth noting that information obtained with the help of DriversCloud (both those concerning our base subassemblies as well as the installed software) can be saved to a PDF document, which can be published on a social networking site, sent by e-mail, placed on a server or printed. 
 
 DriversCloud also monitors devices in real time. This allows you to keep track of, among other things, the voltage or temperature of the processor or graphics card. You can also use the special function of analyzing crashes in the Windows operating system to find the cause of the BSOD.
 
 DriversCloud was also created for users who care about updating programs on their PC. Special technology, using DriversCloud.com, offers the ability to search for appropriate drivers (eg certified). However, this option is available only after performing the configuration using the described tool.
 
 To use the DriversCloud an Internet connection is required. However, you can install an additional module and make use of the program offline.
