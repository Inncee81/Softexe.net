The application is extremely useful if we intend to copy and secure valuable data on the discs. The program removes the following protection from discs - AACS, V12 +, BD +, BDAV and AVCREC. However, it prevents copying data from discs protected by CPRM or ArccoS, but allows their playback.
 
 
 We find in it built-in tools - Passkey for DVD and the second Passkey for Blu-ray. DVDFab Passkey Lite is characterized by a clear interface and performance during the decryption of DVD and Blu-ray discs. Using this software, we can watch and play discs without region limits. 
 
 
 Using the application, we can allow other programs to ripper and copy the entire contents of the discs. DVDFab Passkey Lite is fully compatible with the following applications: DVDFab DVD Copy / Ripper, PowerDVD, TotalMedia Theater, WinDVD, Roxio, ImgBurn, Clone DVD, VLC media player, XBMC, DVDRanger and DVD Shink.
