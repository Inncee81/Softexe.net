It is characterized by lightness, speed and simple operation. DAM integrates with the most popular web browsers - including IE, Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari and Opera, enabling data retrieval via HTTP, HTTPS and FTP protocols. Like most of these types of programs, it offers features for resuming interrupted connections, easily organizing files to download in lists, or dynamic segmenting of data, which allows you to shorten the download time. In addition, the program also allows you to import and export URLs to text files. DAM is available only in the English language version.
