> Downtube is a small application that allows you to efficiently download videos made available through YouTube.

Downtube has been designed in such a way as not to cause any problems to anyone. Just visit the page on YouTube, copy the video link, and then paste it into Downtube to start downloading material to your computer's hard drive. Such prepared images can, for example, be viewed later on a computer or a portable device without having to connect to the internet.
 
 From the main window of the Downtube program, we will not only download selected films, but also we will be able to review them using the built-in browser. However, this is not the end, because the described tool also allows you to convert files to formats: MP4, MP3, MOV, MPEG, SWF, 3GP, WMV or DIVX.
 
 Downtube is also worth installing to download your favorite movies for fear of losing them (some content available on YouTube may be blocked in your geographic location or removed by users).
