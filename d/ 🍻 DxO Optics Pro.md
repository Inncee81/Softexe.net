> DxO Optics Pro is an advanced electronic darkroom, a program for processing photos taken with a digital camera, which allows you to perform the entire process, from selecting photos to saving in the selected format. Unlike others, this program is very much based on the parameters of photographic equipment and thanks to this the processing parameters with its use are very well suited to the pictures.

Thanks to the extensive library of modules, DxO Optics is able to quickly and precisely remove the imperfections of images resulting from the construction of the camera and the lens. The filters were prepared in the DxO laboratory based on a very detailed analysis of the effects of work with combinations of cameras and lenses. Appropriate parameters allow to reduce the curvature and stretch of the image resulting from the use, for example, of a wide-angle lens, reduction of the vignette, sharpening and removal of chromatic aberrations. Of course, the same parameters can be used for many photos, thanks to which removing curves and discolorations from the entire session can be done with a few clicks.
 Precise correction of the geometry of the image allows you to restore the natural appearance of objects on the periphery of the photo. Anamorphic correction enables objects to have the correct proportions and shape, while horizontal and vertical correction facilitates giving the photos a correct perspective. 
 
 
 Fully appreciate the program allows you to process photos in RAW format. DxO Optics provides the parameters of a digital darkroom appropriate for the given camera model and the conditions in which the photos were taken. To ensure optimal processing, the converter used in the DxO software is based on the detailed calibration characteristic of each camera model. Thanks to advanced noise removal, perfect color reproduction and detail reproduction, photos created in DxO are characterized by excellent quality. 
 
 An interesting technology of local optimization and global level of exposure and contrast has been implemented in DxO Optics. Each area of ​​the image is treated as an independent part while maintaining image integrity. Thanks to such exposure treatment, it is possible to achieve a balance between light and dark areas, local contrast settings allow to highlight details in the shade. Such flexible tools also make it possible to "save" photos whose exposition deviates from the ideal one. Using these parameters, you can restore the natural appearance of objects on burned or underexposed portions of your photos or create an effect that resembles an HDR image.
 
 Advanced color control in the DxO Optics program guarantees vivid colors and bright lights, or on the contrary, photos that are aged, faded, patinated. In addition, the white balance control has been entirely handed over to the user. Here, as in the case of contrast and exposure, we can use a multi-point parameter change.
 
 The possibility of removing dust spots, which tend to destroy whole series of photos, is an indispensable tool in every darkroom. In DxO Optics, it is possible to save the pollen removal method from photos and use this template repeatedly. You can also delete unwanted objects, such as cables or columns, using this tool. The background of the image is reconstructed on the basis of fragments surrounding the object being removed. 
 
 The program interface is complex but intuitive. Beginners will certainly be helped by the advice displayed after entering any workspace. Working spaces are adapted to the user's level of sophistication. After a long work with the program and getting to know the tools, it is worth investing some time in creating your own space and placing the most frequently used palettes in it. The photo processing takes place in four steps: selection of photos, applying filters, processing, saving. A separate "card" is prepared for each step.
 
 DxO Optics is focused on mass processing of images, which helps a lot when working with whole sessions with several hundred files. The parameters of each image can, of course, be changed separately, but in the case when many of them are repeated (geometry correction, noise removal, etc.), this program works well. It is also worth taking a look at the predefined parameters of "calling" photos that will certainly facilitate and speed up the work. 
 
 Limitations of the trial version
 The trial version of the program can be used for free without any functional limitations for 31 days.
