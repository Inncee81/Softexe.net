The program is supported by a setup wizard, which guides you step by step through the process of its initial configuration. The user has been given the automatic IP address detection function, informing via email about the change of the current IP address (support for SMTP authentication and SSL connections), support for modification of multiple hosts during a single data update, as well as registering all relevant logs.
 
 DynDNS Updater supports standard wired, modem, ADSL connections and many more. The tool can be run with the operating system or installed in it as a service.
