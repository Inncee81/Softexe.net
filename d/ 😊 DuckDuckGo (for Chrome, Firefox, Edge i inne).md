The extension will show a small floating window containing the DuckDuckGo search box. In the settings you will find a few simple options, including forcing the use of POST, if possible and remembering the previous search. The extension works according to DuckDuckGo's assumptions and does not follow our queries or pass data to advertisers.
 
 DuckDuckGo for browsers allows you to use "bangs", or shortcuts to popular sites starting with an exclamation mark. The list can be found on the search engine's website .
