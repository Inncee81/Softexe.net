> DaVinci Resolve is a non-linear video editing program with very advanced color control and correction tools used in Hollywood hits. The possibilities of color control in this program have already become legendary, as is the high quality of the image created in it.

DaVinci Resolve allows for traditional, non-linear video montage with multiple image and sound paths, providing convenient tools and an intuitive interface, even though it is a professional program. Another advantage is the flexibility of the interface, which allows you to use it in the studio and on the road, with a traditional keyboard and mouse or with a professional editing panel. DaVinci Resolve is also suitable for television productions and film sets, where it is necessary to synchronize shots from multiple cameras and control live color.
 
 
 DaVinci Resolve makes changes to the image based on graphs in which nodes are another change. The program does not limit the number of nodes and branches in any way, which gives a great freedom of editing. Work with colors can take place in the authorial YRGB space and the cinema standard ACES 1.0. We have here the main global controls (temperature, shadows, lights, tinta and the like) and more precise tools, working in specific spaces and their clippings (HSL, LUM). The program has also been equipped with the ability to adjust the color of different shots during editing, advanced image stabilization and face tracking. 
 
 
 DaVinci Resolve also has tools for photographers. If someone has changed from taking pictures to film editing, he will find familiar tools here. In addition, you can transfer the look of your movie clips to RAW files from SLRs. The program was also adapted to work with HDR images (HDR10, Dolby Vision and similar) in ultraHD resolution. 
 
 
 Beginning users will be able to change the layout of the interface to look like Apple Final Cut, Premiere Pro or Avid programs.
