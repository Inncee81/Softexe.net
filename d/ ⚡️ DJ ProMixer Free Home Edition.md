After the first start of the program, you need to fully configure the sound settings. We can choose to input / output audio stream (ASIO) and Direct Sound. In addition, we choose the default device (headphones, speakers) and sound channels for the virtual mixer. It is worth adding that the application supports almost all the most popular devices for DJs (Midi controllers, turntables).
 
  
 The user interface has been optimized and designed by the DJs themselves, thanks to which we will find in it all the most important work tools intended for mixing and creating various sounds on the computer. The program screen consists of two media players, a built-in mixer, a multimedia library and many other useful sliders and key buttons for mixing music tracks. 
  
  
 In the library, you can manage all your multimedia files, create groups and subgroups, and search for different sounds on your computer's hard drive. DJ ProMixer also has functions for automatic detection of bits, adding various effects (echo, Flanger), as well as for changing the tempo of the music being played (acceleration, slowing down).
