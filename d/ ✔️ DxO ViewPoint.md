> DxO ViewPoint is a professional, though simple program, allowing to improve the perspective of photos and reduce distortions resulting from both the angle at which it was made and the design of the lens.

DxO ViewPoint, like other products of this manufacturer, can use lens profiles to remove vignette, barrel and pincushion distortion, characteristic of specific lens models. The program also allows manual correction.
 
 
 Other distortions can be precisely removed manually using several types of tools. Vertical lines, horizontal lines and right angles can be determined. When selecting, a magnifying glass helps displaying the magnification of the selected part of the photo, so you can place the markers exactly. Details can be adjusted manually. You can preview the adjustment effect before saving the changes. At the end, you can crop the photo and improve the horizon. 
 
 
 The program can also work as a plug-in for Photoshop, Lightroom and Photoshop Elements. 
 
 
 The trial version of DxO ViewPoint works for 31 days and there are no restrictions at this time.
