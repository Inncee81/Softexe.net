In the program, we settle the costs of domestic and foreign business trips without any problems. The tool perfectly deals not only with single trips, but also with travels to many places (eg several countries). Noteworthy is the presence of options for managing the database of delegations drawn up, cloning delegations and printing multiple documents simultaneously, automatic numbering of documents and dictionaries of delegated persons, travel routes, destinations and means of transport.
 
 For many companies it will be extremely important to be able to save documents containing information about individual delegations to the PDF format (reports can be prepared and saved also to many other formats, such as XLS, CSV or HTML). It is very useful to export and import data from / to the program via CSV and the Online Backup function, which - as the name suggests - allows you to store the database on the web server. We will also make this backup copy on the local computer.
 
 From the DuoKomp program Delegations can be used on Windows, Linux (Wine) and Mac OS (Crossover) systems. People working mainly in the field will certainly appreciate the ability to run the application (after prior registration) from the level of a USB stick.
