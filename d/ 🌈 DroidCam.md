The program is available for Windows and Linux operating systems. In conjunction with the application of the same name, which we must install on our smartphone / tablet allows you to convert this device to a webcam and use it to record videos on a computer or video chatting with friends via the Internet. From various sources, users inform that DroidCam cooperates, among others with GG, Skype or Hangout.
 
 The use of this small tool is very simple. Depending on the connection method (possible connections via WiFi / LAN or USB cable), the user defines only parameters such as the IP address of the Android device, port for communication, and whether the image and / or sound should be transmitted. From the DroidCam level, we will also configure image rotation and its resolution (from 320x240 to 1280x960p). The program offers an automatic image sharpening function, the use of an LED to illuminate the frame and zoom.
