The program was created for playing live. Its biggest advantage is the rich integration with the Spotify library, thanks to which the DJ immediately has access to millions of songs and the possibility of finding new pieces. You can use 4 decks and a rich set of tools, sound wave visualizations, samplers, configurable crossfader, loops and drumpads for mixing. 
 
 
 The program provides very high quality of sound and effects. Works with professional audio equipment, such as MIDI controllers and external sound cards. Noteworthy are also great tools for syncing tracks, supporting up to 4 soundtracks simultaneously, changing tempo and tone. It is also the first program in which we will find the ability to automatically find similar songs that should blend well with the basic soundtrack. 
 
 
 Interestingly, djay Pro can also be used to display visualizations on an external screen or projector. The program allows you to combine movie clips vividly, superimpose visual effects, layers, transitions and subtitles, and above all use the sound to generate a synchronized image.
 
 
 The trial version of the program can be used for 15 days.
