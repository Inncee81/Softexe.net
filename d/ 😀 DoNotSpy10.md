```sh
DoNotSpy10 is a small application that allows you to quickly change all the relevant options available in Windows 10 for privacy reasons. It allows you to disable tracking elements and postpone automatic updates so that they are installed at other times.

The application is extremely easy to use: it is enough to install it, run it and then select the elements to be switched off and confirm. At the beginning, the program suggests the execution of the system restore point - it is worth performing this operation in order to restore the system for proper operation in case of problems. Among the settings available in the application you will find, among others:
 postponing automatic updates
 user's advertising identifier
 downloading data for the Cortana assistant
 access to the camera, microphone, calendar and account information
 automatic telemetry 
 installation of drivers with Windows Update
 collection of input data
 option to disable synchronization with other devices
 disabling the system browser
 disabling the Wi-Fi Sense mechanism
 
 After selecting the appropriate options, you just need to approve them, and then restart your computer - from then on Windows 10 will no longer collect so much information about us. Note: some applications (including those built into Windows Defender) may treat the program as a threat. This is a false alarm.
