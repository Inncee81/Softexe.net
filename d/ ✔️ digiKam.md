The application supports the majority of camera models available on the market, allowing you to catalog photos taken from the device into albums and sub-albums, commenting on both albums and the photographs themselves and sorting them in chronological order. digiKam supports the "drag and drop" method, thus facilitating cooperation with other applications in the environment. In addition, it provides the ability to manage metadata (EXIF, IPTC, XMP, MakerNote and geolocation using GPS), supports databases and archiving (eg recording on a CD / DVD) with the simultaneous creation of HTML albums.
 
 Among the basic photo editing options you can find, among others correction of red eye effect and basic photo properties (brightness, contrast, color balance, etc.), simple special effects (sharpening, blurring, removing noise), adding text and borders, as well as rotating and changing the photo's size. digiKam also gives you the ability to create MPEG slideshows, export data to your iPod and Flickr and Picasaweb sites, search for duplicate photos and convert RAW data.
