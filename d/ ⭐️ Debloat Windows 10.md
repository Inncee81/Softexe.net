> A set of PowerShell scripts offered as part of the Debloat Windows 10 project allows you to quickly and efficiently master the behavior of the latest Microsoft system. With their help, we will slim down Windows 10, disable telemetry and unnecessary services, block Windows Defender, remove pre-installed Modern applications, disable self-installing applications, links to OneDrive and Windows Update automation.

As a result, Windows 10 should significantly accelerate and our privacy will be better protected from Microsoft.
 
 All scripts (with the .ps1 ending) are run separately, so you can only apply modifications that suit us.
 
 Note: to invoke scripts contained in the package, it is necessary to run PowerShella with administrator privileges, and then issue a command Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestrictedand give consent to all with the key A. In the directory with unzipped scripts, the creator of the project is still ready to unlock individual scripts and modules with commands ls -Recurse *.ps1 | Unblock-Fileand ls -Recurse *.psm1 | Unblock-File. 
 
 Then go to the directory where you unpacked scripts, calling them by name, eg .\remove-onedrive.ps1.
 After running the necessary scripts, we can restore the PowerShell security with the command Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted.
