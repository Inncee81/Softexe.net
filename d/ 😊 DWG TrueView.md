> Free Autodesk tool for viewing projects saved in DWG and DXF. The program was built on the AutoCAD engine and allows you to conveniently view project files - also in 3D mode, with 3D Orbit commands, and allows you to print or plot projects with the ability to choose the scale, as well as AutoCAD.

By using the same mechanisms and tools to display as in AutoCAD, DWG TrueView ensures excellent image fidelity both on the monitor and on the printout. It offers support for objects from products such as Autodesk Building Systems and Autodesk Architectural Desktop. In addition to the functions of viewing and printing DWG and DXF files, the program also gives the possibility of exporting them (publishing) to the compact DWF format.Attention!
 For proper operation of the program, the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 package is required for download in the PROGRAMS section -&gt; Extras -&gt; Libraries and other additions (see: Related Programs).
 The DWG TrueConvert program is currently only available as a component accompanying DWG TrueView.
