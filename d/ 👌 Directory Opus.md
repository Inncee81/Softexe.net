Directory Opus is a fairly powerful and easy-to-use file manager that provides all the basic file operations. It cannot be said that the capabilities of a manager differ in something special compared to similar programs. And the developers themselves indicate that Directory Opus was conceived mainly as a replacement for standard Windows Explorer.

Thus, this application will facilitate the work with files, making it more convenient and comfortable. Directory Opus supports archives, provides access to FTP, processes music files and graphic images, synchronizes with OneDrive cloud storage, and much more.

For more convenient use, the program interface is designed as Windows Explorer, but with a double-window display, which will appeal to both conservative and more advanced users. The menu is fully customizable, there are a number of additional panels and hotkeys available.
