DJ Jukebox is a tool that allows you to manage a library of music and other audio files on your computer's hard drive.

Using this application, we will not only put all the songs in one place, from which we can manage them properly, but also create playlists of individual songs. Interestingly, DJ Jukebox can play songs randomly or based on user ratings (those with lower notes will be run less often or not at all, while the loved "cuts" program will include much more often).
 
 DJ Jukebox was created for music fans who have a really huge library of songs counted even in thousands of files saved in the most popular formats. It contains a number of useful tools to help you manage your songs. You can not only generate the already mentioned playlists, but also change the name of the song, move the entire file directory (the program changes the target track of the song on the current basis if it is in the playlist) or search your favorite songs in the database.
 
 If we have a LAN connection, the DJ Jukebox database can be managed remotely from another computer, provided that the app is installed on both devices. All you need to do is define your keyboard shortcuts to enjoy access to this function.
 
 DJ Jukebox also offers the option of ripping audio CDs to MP3s to enlarge your library. We do not need to limit ourselves to songs downloaded from the web, but we can also put on our HDD songs available early only on classic media.
