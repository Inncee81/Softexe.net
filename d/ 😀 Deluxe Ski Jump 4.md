Another, much more graphically advanced version of the unrivaled simulation of ski jumping. Previous, namely Deluxe Ski Jumping 2.1, despite its very modest graphics was unmatched when it comes to the pleasure of the game and the mapping of weather conditions acting on the agile jumper.

The physics of the flight was significantly improved and a completely new, attractive audiovisual setting was prepared. Thanks to many cameras installed, we have the opportunity to choose the game that suits us best. The most appealing seems to be the picture of the ski jump straight from the camera placed on the player's helmet, but usually the excitement of skiing is over, because putting a successful jump from this perspective just borders on a miracle. The gameplay is still challenging.
 
 
 
 In the full version of the game, we were given a mass of known ski jumps with construction points between 107 and 281 meters. On the largest facilities and under favorable conditions, it is possible to give up to 300 meter jumps! The title also offers additional configuration options, such as the selection of players or the choice of the competition mode (World Cup, Team Cup or online competition). A real treat for all lovers of sports competition is the possibility of sending their results to the official website of the project, as well as the opportunity to download the latest lists of records and the longest jumps. It awakens it, I rule for more.
 
 
 The demonstration demo is significantly limited in many places, offering, among others, only a fraction of the available hills. Paid edition gives 21 additional, multiplayer with an unlimited number of players, team cup, access to global records or database of replays and of course free product updates.
