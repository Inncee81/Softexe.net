The application has much lower functionality compared to the commercial equivalent, allowing only copying the contents of DVDs to the computer disk. BluFab HD Decrypter also allows you to remove CSS, RC, RCE, APS, UOPs, ARccOS, RipGuard, FluxDVD, CORE X2 and AACS security supported by HD-DVD and Blu-Ray discs. The program on the background of the competition is distinguished primarily by the speed of copying data, which lasts on average from 10-20 minutes.
 
 The most functional paid version (DVDFab Platinum) also offers the possibility of converting DVD directly to mobile formats (Generic, iPod, PSP, ZUNE, NDS, Xbox 360, PS3, Cell Phone, PVP and PDA), the option of cutting unnecessary elements from DVDs, dividing and combining movies / scenes or recording data on DVD + R / RW, DVD-R / RW, DVD + R DL, DVD-R DL).
