DX Installer is a low-maintenance and simple tool that is an alternative to the official installer of DirectX libraries mainly used in games.

It supports both 32- and 64-bit edition of the said library, and unlike the original, installs only missing files in Windows. The installation process may be slightly longer compared to the official Microsoft package, which is affected by the strong compression used in the DX Installer. Importantly, the tool contains only and exclusively the original components contained in the directx_Jun2010_redist.exe file.
 
 DX Installer supports Windows XP and newer.
