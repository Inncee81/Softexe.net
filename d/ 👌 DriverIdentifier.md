> DriverIdentifier is a free tool for operating device drivers in Windows. Thanks to it, we can easily update obsolete or install missing drivers for components installed in a desktop computer or laptop.

The program is addressed to less experienced recipients or users who do not want to search and install drivers themselves on the websites of equipment manufacturers. It can be helpful in case we would like to update previously installed drivers to the latest version (because, for example, there are problems with devices) or when we do not have any drivers for a given device.
 
 DriverIdentifier works on a similar basis to most programs of this type. Once launched, it looks for all the drivers installed on your computer so that you can update them if a newer edition is available. The tool will also successfully install missing drivers for devices not recognized by the operating system.
 
 DriverIdentifier is based on a huge and constantly developed driver database. It successfully manages software for all basic devices of leading computer equipment manufacturers.
