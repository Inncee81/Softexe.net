It has a modifiable palette of objects, a built-in spelling checker, allows you to import and export graphic files in the most popular formats (including WMF, EMF, BMP, JPEG, PNG, GIF), work on layers, coloring and text description of objects, etc. Unfortunately Diagram Designer operates on its own file format and does not offer the possibility of data exchange with other tools of this type. However, it works well as a simple tool for both business applications (creating organizational schemes or document flow) and programming (creating flowcharts for the operation of algorithms and / or entire programs).
