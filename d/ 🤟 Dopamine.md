After the first start of the program, you should indicate where the music files are located on the disc. Dopamine will automatically find all files that it can play and add them to the library, sorting by metadata. Dopamine lets you browse the collection by albums, genres, artists, separate songs, and lets you create your own playlists. There were plenty of options to rate songs with asterisks and edit metadata. 
 
 
 In the program settings, you can choose a color scheme (light or dark), choose a leading color, and on Windows 10 also enable the transparency of some elements. In addition, the program can minimize to the system tray, display notifications with the title of the song being played, run together with the system and the like. You can also use your own keyboard shortcuts to adjust the volume and multimedia buttons on your keyboard if you have them.
