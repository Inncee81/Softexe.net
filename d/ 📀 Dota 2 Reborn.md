Dota 2 is another proposition of the game in the genre MOBA or fight in the arenas, but this is not just any game, because prepared by the creators of the series Half-Life or the company Valve.

Large size, but symmetrical maps give equal opportunities to both parties taking part. The aim of the game is to invade the opponent's fortress and destroy it with simultaneous defensive efforts in relation to its own base. The game is played by teams of five warriors composed of appropriately diverse in terms of the skills of the heroes, which the player chooses from the pool of over a hundred available. Characters, of course, as you win more battles, gain experience, advance to higher levels and develop militantly.
 
 A certain variety is also the presence of units controlled by artificial intelligence, which are quite dangerous and must be kept in mind all the time. Their liquidation brings appropriate benefits in the form of various facilities that, when skilfully used on the battlefield, significantly bring closer to victory.
 
 In the game, you can use a special store, where we will buy items needed for playing during the game. Their cost depends on their power and usefulness. It should be remembered that the appropriate use of boosters can radically change the course of the game.
