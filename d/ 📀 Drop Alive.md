> Drop Alive is a free, adventure platform game presented in a very nice audiovisual setting. We direct here the movements of a drop of water, which, being in a mysterious labyrinth full of traps and traps, tries to get to the next planes as soon as possible and with the least possible damage to health, bringing it closer to the final fulfillment of the mission.

The essence of the game and at the same time the key to success is the correct use of the heroine's basic attribute, that is, the ability to change her state of focus from gas, through liquid to permanent. We decide about a particular form depending on the situation and the place where we are currently.
 
 Being a drop, we easily cling to objects and overcome various inequalities, in the case of a pair we travel great up the screen hovering and cleverly avoiding inconvenient obstacles, while in the form of an ice cube we harden like a rock and break uncomfortable barriers.
 
 In addition to a quick escape from the system, a very important element in the game is the systematic ranking of points with free energy enabling the continuation of the mission and allowing the end of the system.
 
 The design is characterized by a very good graphic design consisting of hand-made illustrations. The game is refined in detail and will require a lot of mastery and patience from the player, because reaching the end of the journey will be paid for with many attempts, repetitions and sacrifices.
 
 Attention!
 
 In order to install the game, you should download the Steam program - a special internet platform that allows you not only to buy and download computer games, but also to offer players the opportunity to contact each other, exchange experiences and play together.
