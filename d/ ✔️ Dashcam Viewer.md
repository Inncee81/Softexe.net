> Dashcam Viewer is a tool for watching movies recorded using the car's on-board camera.

The main window of the Dashcam Viewer has been divided into several parts. The largest part of the screen is played by the video material that presents our ride. Of course, we can use the pause function at any time, jump to the selected fragment, and increase the display speed.
 
 On the right you will find a satellite map showing our location during image recording, on-board display (includes, among others, speedometer, weather information, distance traveled and time in which we traveled) and a graph showing the history of the route using the already mentioned parameters.  
 
 Dashcam Viewer allows you to export routes using the GPS locator to popular file formats (CSV, GPX or Google Earth KML), dividing film into parts and exporting fragments to new clips, and combining several materials into one whole (eg to show different situations on the way).
