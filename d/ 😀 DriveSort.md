The program does not require installation and it is enough to indicate in it the appropriate carrier that you need to "sort". In the program window you will see a list of folders on the disk. During the first sorting, you have to set several options, such as sorting long (full) or short (DOS) name, operations in subdirectories and sorting (ascending or descending). You can also choose whether the folders will be mixed up with files.
 
 Sorting can be tested, and if everything is fine - save to disk. The settings will be remembered for the next use of the program.
