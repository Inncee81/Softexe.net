The application has been equipped with the most important functions that allow you to perform almost all activities related to partitions on any data carrier. The program allows, among other things, to create, delete, format and hide partitions, and is also ideal for searching and recovering deleted volumes that have been lost as a result of hard drive failure or the attack of a dangerous virus. 
 
 
 DiskGenius Free supports almost all the most popular data carriers with IDE, SCSI, SATA interface, and supports the following FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, NTFS, EXT2 and EXT3 file systems. In addition, it can recover the necessary data from RAID arrays and has built-in functions to manage virtual storage media (supports Virtual PC, VMware and VirtualBox). 
 
 
 The program has tools for verifying and removing errors on the hard disk. In addition, it enables irreversible deletion of data, without their subsequent possibility of restoration, and can also be used to backup the system and bootable USB storage (supports USB-HDD, USB-FDD and USB-ZIP). 
 
 
 Using this software, we can also rebuild a damaged MBR (main boot record), convert partition tables from MBR to GPT and clone any partition and entire hard disk. DiskGenius Free restores deleted data from the system or specific disk space on the hard disk and from a damaged or invalid partition. 
 Attention!
 The program is available for free, but in comparison to the commercial version it has some limitations that make it impossible to perform various operations on the hard disk - creating a copy of the entire partition to a file, recovering partitions from USB and GPT disks, and restoring files from virtual media and USB. In addition, the function for creating virtual RAID arrays has been turned off.
