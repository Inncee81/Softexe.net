In order for the program to work properly, one should prepare a special background, a simple webcam and, of course, an object to scan eg a statue, a mug or any other thing selected. Then the object should be set in the way presented in the picture and proceed with scanning. Scanned objects can be saved to the Alias ​​Wavefront OBJ format.
 
 Detailed instructions on how to use the program start at the very end of the tool installation stage.
