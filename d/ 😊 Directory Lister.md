Basic functions
 
 With the help of the Directory Lister, we can display, save and print lists of the contents of individual catalogs, and then be able to share such data with other users via e-mail in the following formats: HTML, TXT, XLS, CSV; it is also possible to store information as a database.
 
 Integration with Windows Explorer
 
 Directory Lister can become an integral part of popular "windows" and be available in Windows Explorer. This solution allows the user to access the program functions without having to run the program.
 
 Additional information
 
 The list of files alone is not enough? Directory Lister allows you to add a lot of useful information, including file name, file extension, file type, file owner, file attributes, and more. In addition, there is the function of entering details about the executable file (EXE, DLL, OCX), and if we share the list of owned media (MP3, AVI, WAV, JPG, GIF, BMP), then we can include in it the title of the song, artist name and album , genre, video file format, etc.
