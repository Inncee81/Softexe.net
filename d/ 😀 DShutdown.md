> DShutdown is a small tool, available for free, which not only streamlines the process of controlling the closing of the operating system, but even introduces a new dimension to it. Using this application, we will not only define the conditions for closing Windows, but also make specific applications terminate in specific cases.

Despite the small size, the program has a lot of extensive options in which you can get lost at the beginning. The interface certainly does not encourage, but after a closer look you can see that the functions have been grouped and after some time you can get used to it. The program itself allows defined actions such as shutting down the system (including forced shutdown if it detects that one of the applications "blocks" the operation), entering hibernation, wake up through the local network, or disable a specific network adapter. Each of these options has the ability to configure, including the time of the action, or to provide the mechanism with a password.
 
 In addition to working on a computer with an unpacked program, DShutdown also offers the ability to influence other workstations located in the LAN - it even has the right tool for searching other computers in the local network. The program does not take up too many system resources and, despite the rather archaic interface, is an interesting option for those seeking this type of solution.
