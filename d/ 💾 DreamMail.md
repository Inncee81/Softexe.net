The program has features such as multi-account support, anti-spam filter, automatic data compression (accounts, e-mail, contact list, etc.), viewing e-mail in the form of text or HTML, or creating so-called. black and white lists. An interesting option offered by this client is the ability to view online what messages are on our mailbox. This way you can easily check how many unwanted messages are in our mail.
 
 Another advantage of DreamMail is the fast search speed of the email database and the function that allows you to read RSS feeds directly from the application. In addition, the program offers a large base of ready themes for occasional e-mails (birthdays, name days, anniversaries, jokes, etc.).
