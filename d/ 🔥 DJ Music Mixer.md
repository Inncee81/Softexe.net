The program, although referred to by the creator as a professional solution, is directed to novice users. In addition to the mechanism of the built-in player and playlists, it has been equipped with a 10-band equalizer module, 12-deck sampler, a set of sound effects and a sound recorder. All of them give us the possibility of convenient mixing of two audio tracks, manipulating the sound, enriching your favorite songs with interesting effects and finally recording, and then saving created projects on the disc.
 
 Other, less complex, but often useful in DJ's work, functions that we find in DJ Music Mixer are manipulation of playback speed, predefined crossfade effects (smooth transitions between two tracks) and looping of selected tracks. The list of audio formats supported by the program includes MP3, WAV, MP2, AAC, OGG, AIFF, WMA, AC3, M4A and FLAC. The tool will also successfully support video files and Audio-CD media.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version is not functionally limited and allows you to use the program for 2 hours from the first start.
