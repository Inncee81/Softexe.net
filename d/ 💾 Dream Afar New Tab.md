Dream Afar New Tab - an add-on to Google Chrome that changes the appearance of the newly opened tab in the browser. There is still a search window available on it, but the background fills each time a different, inspiring picture, while shortcuts to other elements (applications, tabs or history) look more attractive. A preview of the weather forecast is also available.

The program is characterized by a large number of settings for this type of add-on. It is also unusual to be able to decide how often photos (from one minute to one day) change and from which sources they should come from: the title Dream Afar, Google Earth and Google Art to choose from.
 
 In the options you will also find the option to change the units and the transparency of individual elements. The user can also manually indicate the location from which the weather forecast will be displayed.
