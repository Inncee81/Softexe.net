> DLNow is a handy and free application that allows you to record streaming content (so-called streaming) available on websites and embedded media into movies or music located on your computer's hard drive.

The program is compatible with a wide range of portals, including not including YouTube, Dailymotion, Yahoo !, BBC, ESPN, Vimeo, Twitch.tv or Facebook and Vine. No problem, so we'll write a funny recording on a hard disk sent by a friend, thus accessing it at any time, even without access to the Internet. The program itself is very simple and it is simply to drag the desired movie to the application window or simply paste its URL. The application itself detects the type of video material, and the user only has to select the quality and press the 'Download' button.
 
 DLNow handles both downloading videos as well as cutting out music only and recording it in MP3 format. Against the background of other applications of this type, certainly a big plus for the tool is support for multiple downloads simultaneously and support for even bulky playlists. Fans of streaming will appreciate the possibility of recording currently ongoing transmissions, e.g. on the Twitch.tv site.
