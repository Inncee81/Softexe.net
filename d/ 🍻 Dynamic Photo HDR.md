Lets you combine underexposed and overexposed images of the same object to achieve the greatest possible tonal range. In practice, this means that the photos processed in this way will be close to what could be seen by the human eye when taking a picture. Dynamic Photo HDR offers many interesting and useful functions even for novice photographers. They allow, among others remove shifts and skews caused when taking pictures without a tripod (Pin-Warping), reduce noise and so-called "ghosts" that are the effect of photographing moving objects on long-exposed images (Anti-Ghosting Mask).
 
 In addition, the program supports the RAW format from most of the most popular digital cameras, it has a whole range of interesting tonal mapping algorithms and filters. The Live HDR Preview function allows you to preview the output effect without having to create an HDR file.
