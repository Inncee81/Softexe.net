This application is designed to relieve users from continuously copying information from one medium to another. DirSync allows you to synchronize an unlimited number of folders in one of the two available data synchronization modes. Synchronization can also be recursive and can be used to create incremental backups.
 
 In addition, the program allows you to change files before the synchronization process, and any problems associated with it may be not always solved thanks to the built-in conflict resolution mechanism.
