DMEX is an add-on to the Windows Explorer, which extends some of its capabilities, among others, to functions related to the placement of windows on the desktop and file operations such as renaming, moving between directories, selective selection and synchronization between folders.

Application functions are available in the form of a small, classic context menu, which is launched after pressing a combination of keys Ctrl + F1on the keyboard at any level of the system Explorer.
 
 Among the options of the program it is possible, among others, to rename files using ID3 tags and Exif data, conveniently move documents to a higher-level directory, or select files from a folder using a mask.
 
 It is worth knowing that virtually all options in the program can also be operated with direct keyboard shortcuts, which can be determined in the settings: they are available from the context menu of the application icon on the taskbar.
