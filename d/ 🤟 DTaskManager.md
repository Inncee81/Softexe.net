```sh
DTaskManager is a free program that can replace the system's task manager and offers a bit more features than the default Windows application. It is a portable program that does not require installation - all you need to do is unpack it from the ZIP archive.

At first glance, the application is very similar to the standard task manager. It has one main window in which individual data is presented in several tabs. We can display and influence active applications, running processes, and the program has built-in tools to check the performance or status of a specific network adapter.
 
 In comparison to the default system task manager, DTaskManager allows not only for forcing the process or application to be closed, but also for freezing and resuming it, just as it does in the Linux family. An interesting addition is also the ability to operate on many processes simultaneously. Despite this, DTaskManager has problems with accurately displaying the activity of the processor, and suspiciously affects the performance of the system. It also happens that the program simply turned off when trying to go to one of the tabs.
