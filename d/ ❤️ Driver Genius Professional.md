Using the program, we can easily and quickly find the missing drivers, as well as update outdated software. Driver Genius finds exactly all drivers for each component installed in the computer, including between the motherboard, network card, graphics and music, IDE controllers, ATA, SATA, and even other system and pointing devices.
 
  
 The program collects driver information and creates backups that we can restore after changing the operating system. Driver Genius scans the entire contents of the hard disk and displays a list of faulty and obsolete drivers, from which users can read the most important information about the drivers' versions and download them automatically from the program itself.  
 
 
 In addition, it provides detailed information about installed components in the computer. It displays the most important parameters of the processor, motherboard, memory, hard disks, graphics and sound cards, and even the network and monitor. In addition, it also has built-in modules for performing database updates and diagnostics of all installed drivers and devices in the computer. 
 Attention!
 The program is available in a trial version and has numerous restrictions that prevent you from downloading outdated or faulty drivers.
