Dying Light is another zombie game in the lead role of the Polish studio Techland, which has built its reputation on the series Dead Island. This time for Warner Bros. himself prepared a production with action in an open, sprawling city where a mysterious epidemic that changed people into undead broke out. The player is sent to him with a secret mission, but his priorities change quickly. He must survive here.

The project, although derived directly from the past achievements of developers, is not just a copy of well-known solutions. The system of preparation of weapons from found parts has been considerably expanded, and the search for hidden plans of an increasingly powerful weapon effectively distracts from the tasks of the main plot. The game is also diversified by numerous non-obligatory missions, this time meaningfully laid out and interesting.
 
 
 A well-trained hero who embodies Dying Light, can bounce off the walls or quickly climb to the roofs, which makes it easier not only to avoid horrible enemies in the day, when he slips unnoticed over their heads or attacks from above. It counts primarily at night, when the zombies fall into a frenzy, they become much more agile, they have sharpened senses and in a mad rush they rush behind the player if they notice him. The piquancy of the game is added to the option of having fun in 4 people via the Internet.
 
 
 Dying Light can show off a detailed and refined graphic design. Once again, the application of the undead partitioning system has been used here. A powerful blow with blunt weapons can calmly deprive opponents heads, while sharp blades in a variety of versions, with added electric shock or fire effect, cut enemies into pieces. From this, among others the product is intended for a mature recipient.
