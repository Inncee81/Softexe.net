> Dust Racing 2D is an interesting proposition for all those who miss racing games shown from a bird's eye view. This free project successfully combines the features of many similar productions from years ago, not sparing too much on the frame, which here specifically remained like two-dimensional. At first glance, the simple proposal draws in and surprises at closer familiarity, especially when competing with a friend next to you.

We start in competitions on one of the gradually unblocked tracks, to obviously fight for the best place in the stake. By car, which is somewhat reminiscent of the resorak, it steers sideways, adding gas and brakes to it. However, you need to learn how to use them so that you can reduce the speed as little as possible on the way to the finish line. It is worth paying attention to the route arrangement, because it is more profitable to cut the bend than to take it at an acute angle. For this clever opponents can play aggressively.
 
 
 The project offers such rivalry with artificial intelligence as well as the aforementioned option for two players, when the game takes place on a split screen. It is also possible to choose the level of difficulty. They enjoy small graphic delicacies, such as the reflection of clouds in car windows. The driving model itself also gives a lot of satisfaction. Cars can be destroyed, but the failure will only result in an outstanding lack of agility.
