The tool is characterized by simplicity of operation. After starting, just double-click on the selected day of the calendar to start entering the necessary information related to the user's plans, and then to color the selected cell, so we can distinguish it from the other days. It should be noted that the Desktop Calendar includes the option to import and export data, which allows you to easily transfer them betweendevices. 
 
 Desktop Calendar also offers the ability to define the type, color and size of the font in the application settings, where you can also modify the spacing between cells and adjust the degree of transparency of the program window. The application also allows you to specify how to display subsequent days, weeks and months, so that the user can customize the presentation of information to their own preferences.
