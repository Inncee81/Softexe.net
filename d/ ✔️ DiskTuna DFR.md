The program is immediately ready for operation right after starting and is characterized by extreme simplicity of use. All we need to do is select a specific medium or partition, then click "scan". After doing this, DiskTuna DFR (Deleted File Recovery) will generate a list of files to be recovered.
 
 Since DiskTuna DFR (Deleted File Recovery) does not require installation, the user does not have to worry about overwriting data. This can of course happen, but the chance of such a situation is much smaller than with the traditional file recovery tools that we need to install on the hard disk.
 
 Attention!
 
 The program is available in a shareware version that prevents files from being recovered. To be able to fully use the DiskTuna DFR (Deleted File Recovery) functionality, you must purchase a license.
