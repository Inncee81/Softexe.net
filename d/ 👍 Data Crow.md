The program makes it possible to create a huge database containing all collected information regarding multimedia files, graphics files and other documents. Users can manually enter information or use an additional online service to retrieve the necessary information from the network. 
 
 
 Data Crow stands out with its rich functionality, as well as a built-in web server and user-friendly interface, which has extremely useful configuration wizards to assist in the execution of certain activities and operations in the program. It is worth adding that it has been equipped with two interface modes - for a beginner and an advanced user. 
 
 
 In addition, it allows you to create a variety of charts and statistics about the database in the program. We can create our own modules for music management, stamp collection or other important data without any problems. Using the program, we get information from many popular websites, such as: Amazon, MusicBrainz or IMDB. There was also a function to import information about multimedia files and create reports in HTML format. 
 
 Attention!
 For proper operation of the application it is required to install Java software version 1.6 or newer.
