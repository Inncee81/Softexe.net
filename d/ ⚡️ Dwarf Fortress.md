Dwarf Fortress is a very unique combination of strategy and RPG game, which shows that when you rely on the imagination of computer scientists, graphics are not the most important. The project developed for years by brothers from the Bay 12 Games studio in some circles has gained a cult status, especially among older PC fans. All because of this, that to be able to enjoy the fun of the game you have to get used to a firmly binding setting.

The world is presented in the form of clusters of multicolored characters, representing various objects. At first glance, everything looks like a random string of characters, but just look at it and start to associate the symbols with functions so that the game will slowly become clear. There is really a method in this madness. Fun can take place in two basic modes. Either we create and develop our settlement of dwarves, or we set out on a lonely dare to conquer adjacent lands.
 
 
 The Dwarf Fortress project is a really complex and complicated game, at which you should spend hours to enjoy the wide possibilities of a kind of archaic program. It is supported by the keyboard, and the commands are quite clearly described. With each subsequent adventure you will enjoy that you have lived a little longer ... The title will not please everyone, but if someone remembers perfectly well the times of the text adventure games, you should definitely give it a chance. It's such a unique.
