> Doomsday Engine is another, extremely refined attempt to restore the classic Doom and games based on the same engine to favor in a world where you've forgotten what it was DOS. Not everyone wants to be involved in running old hits under Windows, for example, so a thriving fan scene meets them, correcting technology errors from the original and the entire graphics.

The initial configuration boils down to indicating various WAD files with individual data compatible with the game program plus any add-ons that are to be loaded automatically. Among other things, various 3D models are supported, replacing two-dimensional objects and opponents. After the start of the right fun, it immediately catches the eye with a much higher image resolution, great lighting effects, as well as full freedom in looking around. Doomsday Engine can do much more, however.
 
 
 In many aspects, this close to modern gaming customers like Steam or Origin. At any moment, the player can create a very clearly designed graphic overlay, the basics of which are taught by a special short tutorial shown at the beginning. We get quick access to the list of notifications (there are even errors), the taskbar from the application menu and settings, including graphics, displaying the image on 3D screens, and even in VR goggles. A number of additional settings can also be found in the options of the game itself, and you can easily join the network game with other retro enthusiasts.
 
 
 
 Attention!
 
 In this version , the DOSBox program is not needed for fun , because everything works, among others under Windows. It is required to download files with the extension WAD, which contain Doom game data, to the GZDoom root directory and select them from the list at the start. The files from the free shareware edition of the blockbuster are also supported , as well as the Heretic and Hexen demo games on the same engine, plus naturally different fan maps.
