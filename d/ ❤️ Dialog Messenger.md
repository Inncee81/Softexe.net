Dialog Messenger is definitely more than a messenger. We are dealing here with a powerful application equipped with various functions useful during group projects both inside and outside the company.

The tool allows you to contact other users in different ways. In addition to the option of sending text messages, Dialog Messenger offers the possibility of video conferences for up to five people (the screen is divided into parts), and there are also free, standard voice calls. Both one and the other solution turns out to be very useful in situations when we can not meet our team members.
 
 The Messenger dialog offers the function of sharing files (text documents, sound files, movies and many others) of unlimited size. Interestingly, the user can also attach notes to the content that he shares with other people. If you have a large number of materials, it is worth using an available search engine to help you locate the data you need.
 
 It is worth mentioning that the Dialog Messenger has a speech recognition function. This is an interesting solution that allows you to leave voice messages to other users. This option also converts speech to text, and then sends the message thus sent to the recipient.
 
 The program contains a special algorithm, thanks to which there is no question of undelivered messages. The Messenger dialog will send them until they reach the recipient. The tool has been optimized for working with the previous (like 2G) and next generation cellular networks.
 
 Attention!
 
 After starting Dialog Messenger will require you to enter the user's phone number in order to send the activation code.
