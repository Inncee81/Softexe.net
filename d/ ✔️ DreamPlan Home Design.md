Using DreamPlan Home Design is not complicated, so less experienced users will manage the program. With the help of this tool, we can very easily and quickly arrange the layout of the rooms of our house, flat or apartment, and even the placement of furniture in individual rooms.
 
 The tool contains numerous objects that can be placed at home or nearby (eg furniture in the living room, bathroom fittings, kitchen appliances in the kitchen or trees in the garden), and allows you to use many different colors (eg to change the color walls or fa√ßades), thus allowing you to design your home according to your preferences. 
 
 It is worth noting that the camera rotating function allows you to change the perspective and observe the layout of the house from any view not only on the ground floor, but also on the floor (or floors), if we create one in the project. DreamPlan Home Design also offers the option of displaying the image in two dimensions.
