> DuOS is an Android runtime environment for Windows systems, created by the popular manufacturer of motherboard software, American Megatrends. The authors assure that the software allows to reproduce the full experience of working with the Google mobile system, including support for gestures on touch screens, support for cameras, sensors and on-screen keyboard.

The application allows you to work in a desktop mode with the use of a physical keyboard and mouse, as well as the integration of Android applications with Windows (you can, for example, attach them to the taskbar, or share them with the Windows file system). The most important advantage of DuOS-M is its performance. In the case of this program, there is no question of any virtualization or emulation. Most likely we are dealing with something analogous to Linux Wine, where Windows applications simply receive an almost complete API "windows", working with the same (and sometimes more) performance as native Linux applications. Only if it turns out that the android application has been compiled directly on the ARMv7 architecture, DuOS-M will try to emulate it.
 
 By using DuOS we can easily run even demanding games. The producer has tried not only to support full-screen mode and gamepads (including PS3 and Xbox 360), but also 3D acceleration, using OpenGL drivers. DuOS-M is to be compatible with the vast majority of applications available on Google Play.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
