Driver Magician is a very useful utility designed to create backup copies, restore and update drivers. It allows you to easily create backup copies of all the necessary drivers and, if necessary, quickly install them, for example, when you reinstall the system. In the program settings, you can select one of four backup methods, including packing data into a self-extracting archive or into a package for an offline installation (installer).

In addition to the drivers themselves, the program can save and then restore other important files: the registry, Favorites, My Documents and Desktop folders.

Moreover, Driver Magician has a database of the latest drivers with the ability to update them via the Internet. It saves a lot of time when you need to find and download a new version of a driver.
