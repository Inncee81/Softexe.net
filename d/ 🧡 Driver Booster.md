Driver Booster is a useful and free tool that allows you to manage drivers for devices in Windows, ensuring that the most up-to-date software that controls the work of various components is always installed on your computer.

The program is easy to use and works so stably that you can install and use it without hesitation, without worrying about the system's efficiency. His main task is to accurately scan the computer and detect all obsolete device drivers. Driver Booster is characterized by high speed of work. The diagnostic process itself takes only a few seconds for a standard computer.
 
 Once the computer analysis process and the drivers installed on it are completed, the tool displays in the main window a list of all obsolete drivers that need to be updated. In addition to information on the exact name of the device to which they relate, Driver Booster also evaluates how outdated the detected drivers are, allowing their efficient and convenient update.
 
 Importantly, the program creates restore points, allowing the system to be restored to its original state in case of failure. In the settings, we can define whether Driver Booster should be launched along with Windows and what time is to be performed driver analysis. The tool supports proxy servers when downloading current software for devices from the database.
