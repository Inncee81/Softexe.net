The program has a fairly simple and intuitive user interface that simultaneously offers all the necessary options, but does not overdo it with an excess of effects and colorful knobs. The application window consists of a "DJ" section at the top, with the help of which we can mix music and the bottom panel in which there is a musical collection that we can use at any time.
 
 For mixing we can use both two and four decks, on which we can add various effects, combine songs or their fragments and more. Advanced DJs will appreciate the ability to add effects depending on the frequency being played. As for a professional application of this type, Deckadance supports a wide range of controllers and other music devices.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version of the program adds five seconds of silence every three minutes of the song.
