The biggest advantage of the application is the ability to emulate security technologies such as Safedisc, Securom, Laserlock, CDCOPS, StarForce and Protect CD. This type of solution is very useful in the case of programs or games that require a permanent installation of the disc in order to work properly. After the installation, the program is available from the system tray (tray), from where it can be easily operated. The application allows simultaneous use of several virtual drives to mount various types of CDs, eg CD, DVD, Blu-ray.
 
 In addition to the drive emulation itself, DAEMON Tools Lite is also equipped with an interesting tool for creating copies of discs. It allows not only to copy the contents of the media to the image, but also to protect it with a password. The program also offers the ability to record image files, however, to be unlocked, you must pay for and activate the appropriate functions. The application allows you to compress images, which is to save disk space when archiving a large amount of data. Thanks to it, we can also mount virtual machine disks and encrypted TrueCrypt containers.
 
 DAEMON Tools Lite is software available for free for non-commercial use. A paid version with extended functionality is also available. The program interface is available in the Polish language version, the application also offers full support for new versions of Windows.
