It is worth noting that Duplicati not only allows you to make a backup of our HDD content, but also allows you to encrypt data using AES-256 or GNU Privacy Guard, and then offers the option of storing the backup "in the cloud". The tool supports the most popular services, such as Microsoft OneDrive, Amazon Cloud Drive, Amazon S3, Google Drive, box.com, Mega, hubiC and many more. In addition, the application supports FTP, SSH and WebDAV protocols.
 
 The whole backup operation using Duplicati should not cause anyone trouble because the authors have prepared a very transparent wizard, where we select next options step by step, and then the program itself starts working. Importantly, before starting the back-up operations, the program informs us of the size of the backup that will be created.
 
 Duplicati provides the option of manually backing up the backup as well as creating a backup in accordance with the previously agreed schedule. If necessary, we can edit your backup and, of course, restore the data when the need arises.
