The application has been equipped with a very simple and intuitive graphical interface based on the Qt library. It brings together a set of easily accessible functions and tools for sketching and painting various kinds of own works of art. Among them, we find options for pencil, brush, eraser, color selector, drawing lines and basic shapes, as well as adding annotations to the project. The user can freely manipulate attributes (size, thickness, transparency, color, etc.) of each of them.
 
 In addition, Drawpile has more complex mechanisms for creating images, such as layers. It is with their use that it is possible to conveniently create breathtaking, composed of many independent elements of paintings. Despite this, the functionality that seems to be the most interesting and which encourages to use this application is the possibility of group work on graphic designs. It's enough that one of the users creates a session in the program, and the rest will join it.
 
 The tool, in spite of its great simplicity at first glance, has enormous potential. From its level, we can create mini-masterpieces at home, but also, together with colleagues, solve various issues by working together on various sketches, diagrams, etc.
