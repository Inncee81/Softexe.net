We are dealing here with production offering elements of strategy and RPG. Dragon Mania Legends, because of the basic assumptions in the fun mechanics, can arouse associations with the incredibly popular game Pokemon GO! In contrast to the work of the Niantic studio, Dragon Mania Legends contains a system of expanding the island, which is one of the many areas that make up Dragonlandia, a fantastic universe where the action of the described production takes place.
 
 Dragon Mania Legends is not just recruiting new units, in this case, dragons, but also playing with these creatures. The player can not only watch them, but also hug, feed and stroke. If he decides to do these activities, he will receive numerous bonuses, especially gold, which is necessary to make progress in the play (eg building new buildings and improving the structure).
 
 Individual clashes in Dragon Mania Legends are carried out in turns, which means that the player can rethink his tactics, and if necessary, even stop the battle and return to it later. In the case of editing on a PC, this is not particularly useful, but the game has also appeared on portable devices.
 
 Dragon Mania Legends is a free game, but containing micropayments. By spending real money, we'll buy crystals to use during the game. This, however, never ends, because the authors still provide new tasks, allowing you to unlock further creatures and more.
