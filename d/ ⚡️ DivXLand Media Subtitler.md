DivXLand Media Subtitler support should not cause anyone problems, because the whole operation of adding subtitles consists in entering dialog lines in the left program window and determining the time to display the prepared subtitles, while on the right you can observe the effects of your work (the preview is immediate, without saving). 
  
 Using DivXLand Media Subtitler, we can edit and repair erroneously translated issues, and then save the effects of your work to a file in one of over 30 supported formats (eg TXT or SRT). The task can be simplified by defining various keyboard shortcuts, thanks to which we will accelerate the execution of certain actions.
  
 DivXLand Media Subtitler allows you to embed subtitle files in video saved in the Avi format, it allows you to extract soundtracks from AVI and MPG movies in MP2, MP3 and WAV formats. 
  
 It is worth noting that DivXLand Media Subtitler requires Windows Media Player to function to ensure maximum compatibility and performance during video playback.
