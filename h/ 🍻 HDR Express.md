The installation of the program is accompanied by the ability to install plug-ins for Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 2 and 3. The program's interface resembles Adobe Photoshop Lightroom and is very readable. The program comes with a set of pre-defined settings, thanks to which you can quickly create an HDR image close to the author's expectations and quickly perform the necessary correction using the "sliders" in the sidebar. There is a preview of the work effect, preview of presets, histogram of the photo and basic photo settings, such as tint, white point, black point, brightness, contrast, temperature.  
 
 You can use RAW images of many popular cameras and raster formats (JPEG, TIFF) to create an HDR image using this program. The finished image can be saved as JPG, TIFF or BEF.
 
 Limitations of the trial version
 The trial version of the program works without restrictions for 30 days.
