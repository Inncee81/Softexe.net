The program provides detailed information about the processor, motherboard, RAM memory, video and audio card, monitor, drives, ports etc. installed in the computer, and its frequent updates ensure that even the latest devices and technologies are supported.
 
 HWiNFO32 also allows you to control the temperature on individual components in the computer (if the manufacturer equipped them with so-called sensors) and perform simple performance tests and compare them with the results in the database, achieved by computers with other hardware configurations. All work results can be saved as a text file, CSV, XML and HTML.Attention!
 A portable version is also available for download, which does not require installation in the system and is ready for use right after downloading.
