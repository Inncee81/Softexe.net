The application offers the user a set of 80 predefined lists with music of different genres. In addition, it has been equipped with a built-in search engine, through which we can quickly find songs of your favorite artist, entire albums, playlists and channels. Headset also offers the possibility of listening to internet radio with music of various types, good to fall asleep, learn, etc.
 
 When playing music outside of the audio track, an image of eg a music video is also displayed. Nothing, however, prevents you from minimizing the video window and focusing on listening to your favorite songs. After creating a free Headset account, you can create your own playlists and lists of your favorite songs.
