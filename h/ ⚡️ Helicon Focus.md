> Helicon Focus is a professional tool addressed to photographers who take pictures in macro or microscopic technique. Nevertheless, it may also be used for processing other types of photographs (portraits, landscapes, architecture, etc.), enabling the user to sharpen and enhance the details of photographs on different plans of the frame.

The software is based on the focus stacking method, which allows you to increase depth of field based on a series of photos of the same frame. It performs operations to separate the sharp areas of individual photographs, and then combine them into a new image with greater depth of field. This technique is addressed mainly to people who take photos in close proximity (eg insects, plants and other small objects) using a tripod.
 
 The program has the functions of correcting slight movements in the pictures and creating from them the highest possible quality of stacks, on the basis of which the final image will be rendered. In Helicon Focus there were also basic tools for photo retouching or text writing. With the help of the application, we will also create panoramas, animations and 3D photos.
 
 Helicon Focus is distributed as a standalone application or extension for Adobe Lightroom. Users of Windows and Mac OS operating systems can take advantage of it.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
