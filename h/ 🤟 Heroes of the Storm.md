Unlike the competition, Heroes of The Storm focuses on short but extremely exciting network battles. The designers of the title made efforts that the meetings did not last here on average longer than a quarter of an hour. At the same time, they devised fun without the use of special objects, promoting their work as friendly to those who did not have time to bite into much more complex MOBA projects. Essentially, the heroes do not combine too much, they only start fighting.
