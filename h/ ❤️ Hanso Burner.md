According to the producer, Hanso Burner has been equipped with modern technology for "burning" the media, and at the same time boasts a very readable user interface, thanks to which less experienced users will also manage the application. Importantly, this tool integrates with Windows Explorer.
 
 Hanso Burner allows you to burn selected files to a CD or DVD (also two-sided), allows you to create rewritable discs and multisession discs, is able to make a copy of the disc (also "on the fly" or using a temporary disc), records ISO, BIN / CUE images on the indicated carriers, and also offers the possibility to open and edit previously saved projects or to remove the contents of media allowing for multiple data storage. 
 
 Following the example of other popular applications of this type, Hanso Burner allows you to read and save songs from Audio CDs to WMA, WAV and MP3 formats; it is also possible to create an ISO image containing songs on a given medium.
