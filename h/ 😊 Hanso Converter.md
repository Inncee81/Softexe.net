Hanso Converter is a tool that not only allows you to convert audio files, but also allows you to rip CD music.

Hanso Converter converts files to the most popular formats, such as MP3, MP4 / M4A, Ogg Vorbis, AAC, Bonk and FLAC. Interestingly, the program can also be used as an uncomplicated multimedia player. After performing various operations in this program, we do not need to enable another tool to become familiar with the modified version of the file.
 
 Almost the entire interface of the program is as readable as possible, but be careful not to confuse the icons "play", "stop" and "pause". Placed above are responsible for the start, stop and pause of actions, while those that are a bit lower are assigned to the built-in media player.
 
 Hanso Converter provides an option to edit metadata and retrieve information about individual songs and entire albums from CDDB / freedb databases. It is also possible to install plugins that enrich the program's functions.
