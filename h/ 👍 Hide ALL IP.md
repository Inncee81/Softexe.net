> Hide ALL IP is a tool for users who value privacy during everyday use of the Internet.

[![Hide ALL IP](https://gallery.dpcdn.pl/imgc/Tools/81962/g_-_420x350_1.5_-_xf71ad628-78a8-469c-af3b-50c00f2ee6d4.jpg)](https://softexe.net/win/security-privacy/other/hide-all-ip:hcfe.html)

After running this program, no one will detect our activity on the network. Hide ALL IP changes the real IP address of the user to a fake one (we can choose from a variety of servers located all over the world), and additionally makes all network traffic of a person using this tool is carried out by encrypted web servers (RSA 2048 and AES / DES). Thanks to this, all remote servers receive information containing the already mentioned fake IP address.
 
 Hide ALL IP makes the user's security much more than during normal use of the network. Hackers will not be able to take over confidential data (eg credit card number), and there will be no personalized ads generated on the screen based on the history of websites visited. In addition, we will get the opportunity to run network sites blocked in our region (for example for the protection of copyright).
 
 Attention!
 The trial version allows you to use the program for just 3 days.
