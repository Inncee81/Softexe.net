The most important features of HitFilm Pro are certainly the ability to work on an unlimited number of audio and video tracks, the option of creating animations, mixing 2D and 3D compositions or finally adding special effects. You can use most of the most popular video, audio or graphics formats to work with the program. HitFilm supports, among others formats such as WMV, MP4, AVI, MOV or MXF. In the case of FX facilities, the creators gave us over 180 effects. The database contains from such basic filters as adding transitions, blur effects, mosaics to the possibility of generating rain, fire, snow, explosions, etc.
 
 HitFilm Pro also offers a set of professional color editing filters that will allow you to create the right climate for selected shots. In addition, the authors prepared nearly 30 ready-made color effects (HDR, 70's, Matrix, etc.) that can be dragged directly to the clip. They can be both the final effect and the starting point for further editing.
 
 The editing of 3D compositions implemented in HitFilm Pro is reminiscent of solutions introduced for example in the Adobe After Effects tool. The virtual 3D camera works realistically, and depth of field is generated based on the distance of the layers from the lens. The program also offers the possibility of creating 3D shadows, generating particles, activating the Motion blur effect for 2D and 3D layers, creating masks and realistic lights, importing data from 3D camera tracking applications and much more.
