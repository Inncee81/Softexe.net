The tool supports the most popular digital music services, including Google Play Music, YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud and Hype Machine. Importantly, individual operations performed using Harmony synchronize immediately with these services.
 
 Harmony allows you to modify the appearance of the main application window by applying many skins (some of them are available immediately after downloading the tool, others can be downloaded as part of free add-ons). The whole is characterized by a modern, user-friendly interface that is easy to read regardless of the graphic variant chosen.
 
 It should also be noted that Harmony allows you to use keyboard shortcuts and multimedia buttons, which means that you can stop a song, select another song or go back to the previous recording with a single button.
