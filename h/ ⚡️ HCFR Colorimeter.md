The program is certainly not aimed at novice users who might get lost among the large number of features offered within it. Unlike other similar solutions, HCFR Colorimeter has the tools to calibrate and manage even the smallest image attributes such as gamma and color correction. The program supports specialized sensors for color measurement, but if we do not have it, the application will simulate it.
