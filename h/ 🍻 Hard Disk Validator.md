Hard Disk Validator is a very easy to use application to check hard drives for the presence of damaged sectors.
```

The tool offers as many as four operating modes, such as: Read (scanning the entire hard disk to locate bad sectors), Read + Wipe Damaged + Read (same as above, but additionally damaged sectors are overwritten and read again, so we are sure that the operation was performed correctly), Read + Write + Verify + Restore (the program will test the disk, verify it, and then restore the original data), and also Write + Verify (the same as before, but the data will be lost). 
 
 Hard Disk Validator displays information about individual sectors in the form of colored icons, where green means that everything is in the best order, gray informs that data has been correctly overwritten, and red indicates bad sectors; we still have a burgundy meaning IO error.
