```sh
Half-Life changed years ago the face of the world of FPP shooters, showing that it's not only the action itself that counts, but also the plot and the right representation of immersive events. The brand quickly made a name for itself, but unfortunately the creators with the continuations were never in a hurry. In any case, it is worth recalling once in a while, from which all the craze for Gordon Freeman in the characteristic suit has just begun.

In the Black Mesa scientific complex there is an accident during one of the experiments, as a result of which the outpost is invaded by visitors from the mysterious planet Xen. Our hero from the case becomes the only person able to oppose them to a certain extent, as well as avoiding the offensive of a special unit sent on the spot in order to cover up the case. Ultimately, we get to where the strangers came from.
 
 
 Half-Life: Uplink is a special edition of the iconic game from years ago. It can be considered in terms of a more extensive demo, but what makes this special edition is the fact that the location, the many facilities and the situations that did not end up in the final product were used here. So we have to do with an alternative vision of the whole story. In addition to a short but exciting adventure, the product also offers an obstacle course in a separate mode.
 
 Attention!
 
 In case of problems with the game, run the program in compatibility mode with one of the older versions of Windows (default is Windows XP Service Pack 3).
