A GTA-style game
 
 The Miami Hotline takes players to the alternative version of Miami from 1989, where we take on a mysterious hero performing the tasks entrusted to him by recording on the answering machine (for comparison, in the already mentioned GTA we received missions receiving phone calls from the booth).
 
 High level of difficulty
 
 Although it may seem that Hotline Miami is an independent production of many, it stands out from many other shooters in many aspects. Above all, the level of challenge mentioned above, because during the game, the character we are targeting always dies from one hit, so you have to be dexterous to pass all the stages. However, we can defeat enemies with the use of firearms and white weapons, fight melee, and even sneak and eliminate enemies without raising any suspicions.
 
 Not for children
 
 The Miami hotline also catches the eye due to its very specific retro style graphics. Although it is not realistic in any case, the game is aimed only at older audiences due to the brutal nature of the game.
