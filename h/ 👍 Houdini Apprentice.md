The package offers all the necessary functions needed to create 3D graphics, including the ability to model, create a skeleton of characters for animation, setting lighting, and simulation of molecular phenomena, physics of rigid bodies, liquids and light materials, such as character clothes. The program has the ability to import models from many file formats used in the industry, including the FBX format developed by Autodesk and presented in 2011 by Sony and Lucasfilm ALEMBIC, which enables easy cooperation of applications with other 3D environments.
 
 The Houdini Mantra rendering engine is available to users, which can also be connected to the Amazon EC2 cloud via the HQueue mechanism. 
 
 
 The Apprentice version is very similar to the industrial Houdini FX, but for the finished renders, it imposes a watermark, and the maximum image we can generate is 1280 Ã— 720 pixels. In addition, it can not be combined with renders of other manufacturers, it can not be incorporated into the production process as a commercial version of the program, and models and resources are saved in its own format.
 
 To download the program, log in to the manufacturer's portal. You can use your account on Facebook, Google+ or another website.
