The biggest advantage of the application is support for multiple processors, which significantly speeds up the process of data conversion and support for 64-bit systems (Mac OS and Linux). To facilitate the use of the application, the authors prepared a list of pre-defined settings for Apple mobile devices (iPod, iPhone and Apple TV). Nothing, however, stands in the way of configuring the application to suit your needs.
