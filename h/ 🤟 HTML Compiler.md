> HTML Compiler is a tool that allows you to convert HTML applications (presentations, e-books, games, photo albums and many more) to separate Windows executables.

Thanks to the capabilities of the HTML Compiler program we can, for example, save your own portfolio from the website to the executable application, and then be able to present them to people without access to the network. The situation is similar in the case of multimedia presentations that we will need at a lecture that will lead those who do not have access to the Internet.
 
 Although it might seem that HTML Compiler has been prepared for advanced users, in essence the program is characterized by simplicity of operation. It allows you to use the user's graphical interface or command line tool by indicating the path of saving the file 'index.html'.
 
 HTML Compiler contains many configuration options, thanks to which we can customize the appearance of the application to your own preferences. We will define the program's color and window style, which will allow us to modify the appearance so that it perfectly matches the content of our portfolio, presentation or any other work.
