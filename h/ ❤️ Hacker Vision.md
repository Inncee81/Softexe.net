Hacker Vision is a small extension for the Google Chrome browser, which is aimed at people who want to take care of their eyes while browsing the Internet at night. It allows you to conveniently change the color scheme to the dark of all websites visited.

Hacker Vision's operation is based on CSS stylesheets and replacements to the opposite values ​​of responses, including for the background color or text on websites. Plugin after installation automatically activates and does not have the mechanism to automatically recognize the time of day (even after the current hour), therefore the user must manually enable or disable the extension if necessary.
 
 The tool that Hacker Vision undoubtedly avoids excessive eye fatigue during the night surfing on the Net, however, is not free from defects.
 
 Unfortunately, the biggest fact is that the plugin always modifies stylesheets and, as mentioned, changes the corresponding page attributes to the opposite - even if you visit a website where dark shades predominate. You must manually disable the extension.
