The program is characterized by the richest set of tools from the Home Designer family and a huge database, containing a lot of useful three-dimensional objects such as: doors, windows, walls, floors, ceilings, furniture, and home electronics and household appliances. When creating a new project, we can start work from scratch or use the help of a built-in wizard containing templates with ready and furnished rooms and with other necessary graphic elements (pools, gardens, farms, green areas).
 
 Home Designer allows you to design and arrange the interior of any room - kitchen, living room, children's room, bathroom or bedroom. In addition, it has tools to create infrastructure around the building, including the pool, garden, playgrounds and garage. Another advantage of the application is the ability to preview or present your own home in full three dimensions. It's not everything. Its resources also could not miss a two-dimensional projection with the help of which we draw different cross-sections and elevations of the building.
 
 
 The application has a huge number of available features that allow, among other things, for professional creation of roofs, stairs, ceilings and storeys. It is also worth mentioning computer-aided design (CAD), enabling the creation of a home from the technical side. Users can also estimate the cost of building the entire house, using a tool that generates a complete spreadsheet containing an accurate cost estimate. 
 
 The Home Designer program in the demo version has limitations that make it impossible to save, export and print finished projects. The program can be downloaded after registering on the manufacturer's website. The activation code will be sent to the provided e-mail.
