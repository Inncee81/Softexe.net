The HiBit System Information user interface is extremely intuitive. It has been divided into three separate tabs, such as: summary, hardware and software. The first one contains basic information about your components and applications, while in the others you will find a lot of details about them.
 
 When it comes to hardware, HiBit System Information collects data about the processor, RAM, motherboard, BIOS, display, hard drive, printer, network card, sound card and devices connected to the USB connector. In contrast, in the case of software, the tool allows you to read the information about the operating system, antivirus program, firewall, running processes, drivers, installed applications and more.
 
 HiBit System Information also allows you to export data to an HTML file, which you can then save to your hard disk.
