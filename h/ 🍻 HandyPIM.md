> HandyPIM is a tool that can be easily described as an electronic organizer.

The program provides a calendar, allows you to manage contacts, allows you to take notes and offers access to the list of tasks. HandyPIM has a function of setting reminders, thanks to which we do not miss an important meeting, and if we want to have information about the upcoming event, "on the eye", we can print the note and place it on the corkboard or in any other visible place.
 
 Using the HandyPIM application you do not have to worry about data loss. We can define work schedules of the tool that will automatically back up our profile. Individual information contained in the program database is worth password protection (the application uses a 256-bit encryption algorithm).
 
 The appearance of individual elements can be adapted to your own preferences so that only the components you need appear on the screen. HandyPIM allows you to modify the type of font, its size and color. You can format text, images and tables in notes, making them stand out from other entries.
 
 HandyPiM offers the function of importing data from other organizers (Outlook, iCalendar, vCard, CSV and TXT), as well as exporting the contents of your account to a file. In addition, you can synchronize your calendars, contacts and tasks with a Google account.
