Helicon Photo Safe is a convenient graphics viewer that allows you to organize and manage a large number of photos. With its help, we can catalog all your photos in several ways, import images from digital cameras, burn them to discs or protect against other computer users.

The application allows us to browse photos, among others in slideshow mode, assign them to categories, rate and publish on social networks Flickr, Picasa and Facebook. Helicon Photo Safe offers the possibility of importing photos directly from digital cameras, burning a set of photos onto CDs / DVDs, as well as placing them on Google maps (thanks to the GPS coordinates recorded by the camera or smartphone).
 
 The program also includes the function of searching for duplicate images, comparing two photos, as well as hiding them from other users. In the case of the latter function, it is implemented using special safes created directly from the application level. Photographs embedded in them are encrypted with one of the 3 advanced algorithms and not available from the Windows Explorer. Access to them is possible only from the Helicon Photo Safe level after providing the previously defined password. If you forget a password at some point, the program will send it to us by e-mail.
 
 Helicon Photo Safe supports the majority of the most popular graphic formats, including RAW files generated by professional digital cameras. The list of supported graphic files includes BMP, JPG, JPEG, JP2, TIFF, GIF, PSD, DNG, X3F, RAF, CRW, CR2, PDC, MRW, NEF, ORF, PEF, SRF and PMP.
