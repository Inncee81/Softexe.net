In spite of its simplicity, Hugin is considered a tool with enormous possibilities and with which you can create excellent panoramas from not necessarily perfect photos taken with a simple digital camera. The program, apart from combining and overlaying photos, also allows you to search and optimize control points, correct distortions of perspectives, create projects with vertical, horizontal, multi-row orientation and many others.
 
 
 With the release of the 2013.0 version, the interface has been divided into three modes: basic, advanced and expert. In basic mode, we can fold pictures into a panorama in three simple steps. Tools such as correction of distortions, deleting objects or moving control points have entered the modes for more experienced users. 
 
 
 Hugin is a great tool for fotoamators, offering a friendly interface in Polish.
