> Honeycam is an easy-to-use program that allows you to record (record) the contents of the desktop, and then save the recorded material in the form of animation in .GIF or WebP / WebM format. In this way, we can record even a short instruction or convert to GIF a funny movie recorded by mobile phone or found on the web.

The program is characterized by a consistent and user-friendly user interface and simplicity of use. The main application window allows you to access individual program modules: Record (record), Edit (edit previously saved files) and Import (allows you to import static image files and create GIF animations from them). The recording window itself tells us the size of the recorded area in a simple and visible way, we can also quickly change such options as enabling or disabling the "always on top" option, set the frames per second while displaying the animation and manually define the size of the window.
 
 After recording the sequence, the program automatically opens the editing window, showing the main information about the recording and allowing its recording as GIF, WebP or WebM - in addition, each of these formats can be modified to a certain extent. A quality indicator is also useful, which allows you to find out how much you will lose on conversion to a different format. In the editing mode, we can add various extras to our animation, such as text, custom watermarks, or use one of the built-in filters.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to record a maximum of 10 seconds of sequence. In addition, the program places the manufacturer's watermark in the animation.
