The program requires an in-depth scan of the hard disk, during which a detailed list of suspicious operations appears on the screen (relevant information can be exported to a log file). By clicking on a given log, right-click on the detailed information about it, and then decide what actions we want to perform.
 
 HiJackThis Fork is an easy-to-use application, but nevertheless it has been prepared exclusively for experienced recipients. Less-familiar users can delete the necessary data, leading to operating system failures.
