> Chrome Cleaner Pro is a plugin for Google Chrome, thanks to which we will make this web browser work much faster.

After starting Chrome Cleaner Pro, we will be able to choose what data we want to delete (e.g. search history, cookies, extensions, temporary files), and define whether we intend to get rid of all stored information from the last hour or from a longer period (e.g. day).
 
 Chrome Cleaner Pro will make Google Chrome a more powerful tool. However, this is not the end, because with the help of this addon we will free up space on the hard disk of our computer, where there are unnecessary files originating, inter alia, from websites that we have not looked at for some time.
 
 It is also worth mentioning that the use of Chrome Cleaner Pro also increases the user's safety, because all traces of his activity on the network can be removed using this plug-in.
