The Neverware company is responsible for the preparation of the machine, which provides its own builds of Chrome OS in the free version (Home version without an administration console) and in commercial variants. On its pages you can find images thanks to which the system can be installed on your computer's hard drive.
 
 Chromium OS is an open version of Chrome OS. Thanks to the virtual machine, you can check the possibilities of this operating system without having to buy a blind device. Chromium OS on a virtual machine has many limitations to Chrome OS: no availability of the Google Play store, support for only one resolution and much lower performance.
 
 Attention!
 For detailed instructions on starting a virtual machine from Chromium OS on VirtualBox, see our Chrome OS publication on the virtual machine .
