The goal of the authors of Crusta Browser was to create a small application (it takes slightly over 160 MB on the hard disk), which loads subsequent pages in the blink of an eye. Therefore, next to the address bar you will find a counter, which will help you find out at what time the given website was started. In addition, we receive here other useful solutions, such as the ability to create a list of the most visited addresses, the option to convert text to speech, the function of viewing PDF documents or the option of creating screenshots.
 
 Seemingly, it might seem that tabs have been placed on the left side of the main window of the Crusta Browser program, but in fact clicking on the selected icon of a given site (by default Facebook, Twitter and Time.is), we run it in a smaller window. We can simultaneously use, for example, a social website (responding to messages) and an information portal (read the news).
