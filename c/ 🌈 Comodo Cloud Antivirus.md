Thanks to the use of modern technologies Comodo Cloud Antivirus offers complete protection against malware of all kinds. It analyzes the operations performed on the computer on an ongoing basis, which allows to protect the PC not only against known but also unknown threats. Additionally, there is an option to run suspicious applications in an isolated environment.
 
 Comodo Cloud Antivirus is characterized by a modern, transparent user interface - the creators focused on "tiles", thanks to which the use of individual program options will not cause any problems for even less experienced customers. From the main screen they are informed about the threats, and in order to scan the contents of the hard disk (all or individual files or folders), they must press the appropriate options on the screen.
 
 It is worth adding that Comodo Cloud Antivirus, although it makes use of "from the cloud", can be a very useful tool also in offline mode (without connection to the network). In this case, however, you have to reckon with the fact that the program will not protect the user against all threats.
