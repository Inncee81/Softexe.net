We are dealing here with production that only offers multiplayer fun. We can take sides on either side of the conflict by joining the Global Risk or Black List team to cooperate and compete with other players on a variety of maps. It is worth noting that in one session, a maximum of 16 users are involved, who control the heroes representing different character classes, which allows to adjust the style of the game to their own preferences.
 
 crossfire offers the opportunity to test your skills in classic gameplay modes, such as Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch. In addition to them, production provides solutions that are in vain to look for in competing titles. It is worth mentioning the Ghost Mode, where one team has only knives and is designed to detonate explosives, and the second does everything to prevent it, which is not easy, because the enemies are invisible, because they are wearing camouflage costumes.
 
 Before you start your adventure with crossfire, remember that we are talking about a game released in 2007. Therefore, it can not boast of a high-quality visual setting, but it can easily work even on weaker computers.
