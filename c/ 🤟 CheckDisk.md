CheckDisk is a tiny (because it takes less than 400 KB) and a free tool, designed to search and then eliminate errors on the disk. It can analyze the device in 3 modes - superficial, thorough and with the option of error checking.

The program allows you to scan the disk sector by sector and mark those damaged as unusable. CheckDisk supports all hard drive models available on the market - including SCSI buses and RAID arrays. The advantage of the application is no need to install - it is ready for use right after downloading.
