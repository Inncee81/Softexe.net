Thanks to Cloudevo, we can configure multiple accounts and gain access to them from the level of the described application. It supports both the most popular services, such as Dropbox, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, but not only. The program can also be used by people who store data on a daily basis through 4Shared.com, pCloud, HiDrive.com, Mega.nz and many, many others. The full list of services supported by Cloudevo is available after clicking the "add account" button in the bottom right corner of the screen.
 
 Cloudevo can be run as a separate application running in the Windows operating system, but it also integrates with Windows Explorer, where it appears in the form of a virtual drive. This makes it much easier to manage your documents, photos, videos or any other files. You also do not need to worry that they will be intercepted by unauthorized users, because Cloudevo will secure them using 256-bit AES encryption.
 
 As you can imagine, Cloudevo has an automatic synchronization function, so there is nothing to prevent you from using the program on multiple devices. 
 
 Attention!
 
 You must create a free user account before running Cloudevo.
