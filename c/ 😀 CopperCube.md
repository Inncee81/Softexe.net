In total, CopperCube allows you to import up to 17 different file formats. The application also allows you to render 3D scenes on websites using Flash or WebGL. After starting the program, we can choose which kind of scene we want to create - 3DS, a panorama or run the sample scene added to the library by the company's programmers. After loading the file, CopperCube allows you to view textures, their arrangement, as well as properties and behaviors. Each texture can be animated in a separate window - thanks to that we get a preview of individual elements of the scene. The user also has the opportunity to add their own elements such as geometric shapes, textures from files, photos, as well as lines and sounds. Further functions are related to editing the light, shadows and resolution.
 
 CopperCube is available in free and paid version. Demo has several limitations - including does not allow viewing statistics of edited scenes. In addition, it can be used only for 14 days.
