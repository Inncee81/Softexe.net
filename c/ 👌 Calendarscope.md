In Calendarscope calendar, we can put information about upcoming meetings with clients, birthdays or namesakes of family members or friends, as well as occasional events and many other events that we should not forget about. The program divides the tasks into active, overdue, completed and other tasks, and also includes the option of dividing "tacks" into categories.
 
 The application allows you to easily view the saved data - we can read all entries for a given day, week, month or even year and transfer them to another date using the drag-and-drop technique. 
 
 Calendarscope allows you to enter one or more recurring events, and also offers a reminder setting function. You can customize them to your preferences, for example by highlighting a given event with any color or using a different font.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
