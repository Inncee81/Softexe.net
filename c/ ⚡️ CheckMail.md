> CheckMail is an e-mail client with support for POP3 and SMTP protocols, which allows you to send and receive e-mails, as well as displays notifications when new messages appear.

It is worth noting that CheckMail allows you to configure any number of e-mail accounts, and can also act as a POP3 or SMTP server, collecting messages from multiple accounts and storing them locally. Before downloading a new message to your computer's hard disk, the program allows you to read its preview. Thanks to this, we can easily prevent unwanted e-mails from being downloaded (eg spam) or messages with a large size attachment, which we are unable to download on a given internet connection.
 
 CheckMail offers the option of defining custom notifications for different accounts or e-mail addresses, and allows you to sort and filter messages. Importantly, the tool does not run any attachment files, which virtually eliminates the risk of introducing an infected file to our computer.
