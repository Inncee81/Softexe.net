Carneto Light allows you to sell single and multiple use passes on the customer's card. In this way, it is ideally suited to work in the following service points: gyms, car washes, dance schools, fitness clubs, tanning and massage salons, and various sports and recreation facilities. 
 
 
 By using the software, we can set up and run our own customer base, along with additional photos, addresses and phone numbers. Carneto Light allows you to assign a card to a regular customer at a service point, and also allows you to inform customers about changes, new services and various promotions. 
 
 
 Carneto Light offers the ability to manage and account for each client from any number of units - time, visit or service. The application can also define many different passes, which differ in the number of saved units (e.g. 50 min, 75 min or 100 min). In addition, it can be used to sell new passes, as well as to modify them using a simple editor. The program can also be extended with additional modules that will expand the offered functionality. 
 
 Attention!
 During the installation and activation of the program, you will need to provide a tax identification number (NIP). To download the program and install it in the operating system, you must register for free on the manufacturer's website . The data required to log in to the application will be revealed when downloading the program from the official website of the manufacturer.Carneto Light is available for free in comparison to the commercial version, but it has numerous restrictions on the use of season tickets (up to 20 cards), booking reservations and when managing the customer base.
