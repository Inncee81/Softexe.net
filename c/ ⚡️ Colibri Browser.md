Many people will treat Colibri Browser as a curiosity, because the tool, unlike from Firefox or Opera, allows you to open only one card. Such a solution may seem out of place, but in the case of the described tool it works perfectly, because thanks to it Colibri Browser is characterized by unusual speed of action.
 
 Colibri Browser provides very useful keyboard shortcuts, thanks to which we can go back to the last page, go to the next website, refresh the image, add the selected address to the list of links, and change the view or start Google search.
