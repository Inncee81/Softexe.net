> CAM is a tool for monitoring the components of our computer. It is characterized by simplicity of operation and a modern interface.

After starting the CAM program, the system presents a short tutorial, allowing you to familiarize yourself with the basic options. We learn from it, among other things, that the authors have prepared two data display options (basic and advanced), and a special tab presents the exact specifications of our PC, while the next one allows for detailed monitoring of individual systems. There is also an option to check the FPS (frames per second) in the last session with the selected computer game (however, you must first activate this function in the application options).
 
 The CAM will immediately inform the user when the component malfunction occurs (eg too high temperature of the processor). You do not have to worry that using the GPU overclocking option, which is also available in the program, will damage this system.
 
 The first time CAM is started, the user is asked to log in. A free account can be created on the official website of the program; You can also use the account you have on Google or on Facebook. Alternatively, you can start using the application in guest mode, but in such a system we do not have all the functions offered by this tool.
