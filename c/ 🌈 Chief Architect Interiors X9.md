> Chief Architect Interiors is a professional tool for interior design of various types. It works best in home rooms, such as bathrooms, kitchens, bedrooms for children and adults, and lounges. The program allows you to design on 2D plans, as well as in a three-dimensional view, in which it shows the room from a selected perspective and gives the opportunity to "cut" the project. In the catalog of models we can find thousands of basins, bathtubs, cabinets, tables, couches, household appliances, trinkets to "position" on shelves and textures imitating finishing materials.

Planning the space in the Chief Architect Interiors program involves redrawing the room plans, and then placing the objects in space and giving them dimensions. In the library you can find an assortment of specific producers, thanks to which the designs perfectly reflect the final appearance of the rooms. You can also create your own models or import them from other programs. 
 
 
 Chief Architect Interiors will show the full power in the design of kitchens and bathrooms. The program has been equipped with tools that allow you to easily create sets of cabinets in a selected style with any shape, with tops or borders. The program recognizes, for example, if a piece of furniture is placed in the corner of a room and automatically selects a corner type of furniture. The program also has automatic dimensioning tools, in accordance with the standards of the American organization NKBA . 
 
 
 The program allows you to generate elegant visualizations, sets of plans and cost estimates, containing a list of materials and furniture that you need to buy. Renders can be presented in photorealistic, "watercolor" or color with contours. When creating a visualization, you can use different textures from the library and any graphics.
