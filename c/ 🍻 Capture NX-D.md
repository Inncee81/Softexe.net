The application is aimed at the owners of a Nikon digital SLR camera, a Nikon 1 mirrorless camera with replaceable optics, a COOLPIX compact camera recording RAW images and other cameras using this method of recording photographs. 
 
 With the help of Capture NX-D, we can retouch pictures saved in RAW format in a very quick and easy way. Uses native processing technologies using the functionality of Nikon cameras. Thanks to the application, we will also edit pictures in JPEG and TIFF formats, but in this case we only talk about access to basic options.
 
 Capture NX-D makes use of large screens and multiscreen environments, giving users easy-to-use sliding pallets. It also allows you to browse photos in a variety of modes, and even compare photos (before using the program options and after retouching the selected photo).
