Cryptomator is an open and free data encryption tool that has been designed to work with all online disks that use synchronization mechanisms with local catalogs. The entire encryption takes place on the client's side so that the data does not fall into the hands of unauthorized persons

AES with 256-bit key is used to encrypt data. The program creates special "crypts" (in any number), in which the structure of directories, file names and their sizes are hidden, so that the attacker will not be able to infer anything even from metadata. Each of these "crypts" can have their own individual access password. 
 
 
 The program's operation is very simple - after starting the program and clicking the + button, a new crypt is created, and then it is selected in the folder that is used by our online disk. Then enter the access password, enter it again to be sure - and that's all. The program will automatically create a virtual resource connected after the WebDAV protocol, which will be accessed by a normal file manager.
