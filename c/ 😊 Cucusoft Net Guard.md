Using the program, we can allocate the monthly limit of data transfer and from the created chart read the most important information about the used file transfer in a given month. In addition, Cucusoft Net Guard displays which programs most downloaded or sent data to the Internet. 
 
 
 The program also includes a tool for monitoring all active outgoing and incoming calls. With its help, we can observe the speed of downloading and sending data through various applications and processes running in the background of the operating system. Cucusoft Net Guard is also used for increasing data transfer, neutralizing malware, and for thoroughly checking the speed of a broadband connection. 
 
 
 Particularly noteworthy is the additional function that monitors and controls all connections to the broadband network. It displays a detailed list with all active connections, from which we can easily read the name of all files, TCP / UDP protocols and external and internal IP addresses.
