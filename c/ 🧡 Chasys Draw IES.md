The program has been equipped with a number of useful and frequently used tools that were located in a transparent toolbox. You can find functions that allow you to draw lines, all kinds of shapes and figures, paint using a brush or spray, apply text, manage colors and perform many other operations. For digital photography enthusiasts, the creator has prepared a set of the most commonly used filters and effects. With their help, we can easily and quickly improve the quality of photos or previously prepared own works. In addition to the aforementioned layer mechanism, a function of an extensive history of performed operations is also offered. It allows easy withdrawal of introduced changes, which is important especially when working on larger and more complex projects.
 
 The rich functionality does not end, however, on the set of tools described above. The program also allows you to prepare a printout of selected graphics, design labels for discs, create animations for websites in GIF or AVI format, capture images from webcams, create icons and animated cursors, and perform so-called. screenshots and screencasts. An important advantage of Chasys Draw IESa is support for plugins through which you can expand the program's capabilities.
 
 Along with the program, the Chasys Draw IES Viewer graphics browser is also installed, the RAW Chasys Draw IES raw-Photo file service tool and the Chasys Draw IES Converter graphic file converter.
 
 Chasys Draw IES offers support for multi-core processors as well as scanners, touch screens and tablets. Working with the program should not cause problems to anyone who has previously used such solutions as Paint.NET. The Chasys Draw IES interface and the layout of individual tools are almost identical to those used in most of this type of graphic programs.
