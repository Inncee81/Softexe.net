Classic Theme Restorer is a small Mozilla Firefox browser plugin that is designed to change the visual shell of this web browser. Starting with version 29, Firefox developers have significantly changed the appearance and interface of their creation. Not all users of the updated design came to taste, and if you are one of them, then this extension will allow you to return to the usual look of your favorite browser.

Immediately after installing the add-on, the familiar Firefox icon will appear in the upper left corner, where all the main application controls and browser settings are placed. The extension itself has quite diverse options for individual and flexible customization of the browser according to the preferences and desires of the user himself:


tabs appearance and location,
color themes
"Firefox" button,
primary and secondary interface
addons management page
type of address bar,
toolbar composition and more.


In general, everything is quite simple and clear - experiment with the settings and choose the most suitable option for you. Now, Firefox will have an interface as close as possible to its classic initial look, while you can use the most current version of this web browser.
