Corsair Link is a useful tool whose task is to monitor the operating parameters of the computer's subassemblies. From its level, we will get information about the processor, RAM or graphics.

The huge advantage of the program is a refined and clear graphical interface, as well as simplicity of use. Corsair Link presents the data in an accessible way about the degree of processor usage, temperature of individual cores, the frequency of RAM operation or the temperature of the graphics card (both built-in on the motherboard, as well as the dedicated one) and the hard disk.
 
 Importantly, the application can alert the user when any of the components reach critical values. There was also an option to manage the fans and save logs of individual information about the operation of the previously mentioned computer components.
 
 In addition to the above-mentioned functions of the program, one should mention the possibilities that it gives to the owners of advanced Corsair power supplies. I am talking about the option of tracking the load of the power supply and the voltage generated by it.
