The program is directed to experienced users who will appreciate its speed of operation, as well as a clear interface. Caustic offers up to 14 different tools (instruments / synthesizers) that allow you to compose digital tracks: Subsynth, PCMSynth, BassLine, BeatBox, PadSynth, 8BitSynth, Modular, Organ, Vocoder, FMSynth, KSSynth and SawSynth.
 
 Launching Caustic for the first time we will see on the screen numerous tutorials (in English), which you should read before you start working on your creation. When looking for additional information, we should look at YouTube, where useful tutorials are available (links to these materials can be found in the main program window).
