The tool downloads the latest version of the iTunes player from the Apple website and installs only the necessary drivers to operate the apple bitten devices from the downloaded file. The application is definitely useful when you want to use other tools to manage the content of our devices, but we do not want to clutter your computer with a rather heavy program like iTunes.
