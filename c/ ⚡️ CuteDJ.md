The application has an extensive, graphical interface, which may seem not very intuitive for completely new users, but this is a feature of most programs of this type. Despite its small size, CuteDJ has quite a lot of built-in options and options. An important issue is compatibility with a wide range of devices - specifically the application supports more than 70 controllers and interfaces, allowing you to use almost any device of this type.
 
 In addition, the program offers everything you would expect from an application aimed at DJs, i.e. the ability to loop fragments, mix, add sound effects, smooth transitions between songs or their fragments, synchronization of bits and more. An undoubted advantage is the integration with the iTunes music library and the ability to import your own music from any source.
 
 Attention!
 
 The demo version of the application works only once for 20 minutes - after this time it must be restarted to continue working.
