Clip Studio Paint Pro allows you to draw in three ways. With a pen tablet, you can draw by hand and in this case, the program will interpret the pressure correctly if the tablet provides such data. The pressure curves can be adjusted in the program settings. In Clip Studio Paint you can also draw vector on special vector layers and paint fillings with patterns, effects and patterns. The program has a lot of brushes of this type, so you can put on the illustrations leaves, stars, lines, ribbons, barbed wire and the like. More brushes, materials and patterns can be found in the resources on the program page. The icing on the cake is the ability to draw with transparency, which is like painting with watercolors.
 
 
 When coloring the illustration, you can use the option of gradient painting, filling with automatic closing of lines and painting of small fragments that have not been filled in automatically, which significantly speeds up the finish of the illustration. You can adjust the colors and correct the figures in the illustration at any time.
 
 
 You can use templates and drawing frames when drawing comic cards. We also have a set of rulers and rulers. When painting manga, you can also quickly convert color illustrations to black and white, which imitate the style of comics.
 
 
 
 The same installation file allows you to test two variants for 30 days: Clip Studio Paint Pro for creating illustrations and Clip Studio Paint Ex for manga drawing. There is also a version of Clip Studio Paint Debut, designed to create animations.
