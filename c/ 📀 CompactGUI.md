The tool, in fact a graphic overlay on the Compact.exe system mechanism, gives us the ability to perform compression at the file system level. Unlike standard programs for data compression, it does not create typical archives and does not affect the performance of compressed games or software, or the speed of reading / writing data. It is directed mainly to holders of SSDs with a small capacity, but it can also be used successfully by large disc disk holders of considerable size.
 
 CompactGUI is very easy to use and, as the creator suggests, it allows up to 60% reduction of disk space occupied, for example, by the game. The tool offers 4 advanced compression algorithms (XPRESS4K, XPRESS8K, XPRESS16K, LZX), which basically differ only in the degree of compression and of course the time needed to compress the data. Interestingly, the program can estimate the output size of the data before they are compressed.
 
 The CompactGUI cover is distributed in a portable form (portable) and requires no installation. It is directed to the owners of Windows 10.
