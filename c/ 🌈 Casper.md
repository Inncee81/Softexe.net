> Casper is a tool that allows you to create a full Windows backup with installed applications, photos, music tracks, emails, documents, as well as settings.

The program should be used prophylactically, in the event of a hard disk failure (not only physical, but even when it is infected with a virus) you did not have to re-create the operating system, but use the previously prepared ISO disk image, where we placed earlier Windows with all our data. You can create it manually, or you can define a schedule according to which Casper will regularly create a backup.
 
 Casper not only supports standard HDD, but also supports SSD and USB external memory. We can not only create back-up data in the traditional way, but also clone the Windows operating system with settings to place it on the hard disk of another computer.
 
 If we need to install Windows from a boot image, Casper will also allow us to create such a disk. Regardless of what operation we will carry out using this tool, we will see the speed of the application, which is equipped with modern technologies. It is thanks to them that Casper works fast, and the risk of any errors (in ISO disks, during cloning, etc.) is virtually nil.
