Overall, the preparation of the cover image requires the user's graphic capabilities, but thanks to the use of the wizard and templates included in the Cover Commander program, you can prepare your own project with a few clicks. Additionally, it is possible to implement various effects (eg adding shadows) in order to increase the visual attractiveness of the created cover. These effects can be saved in a separate file, and then used in another project. 
 
 Cover Commander will find its application not only at home, but also when designing multiple graphics at the same time. Batch mode allows you to work on multiple covers at the same time. The maximum image size can be up to 4,000 by 4,000 pixels.
 
 In connection with the above, Cover Commander is an interesting alternative for people who can not afford to buy an expensive graphic program (eg Adobe Photoshop) and spend time learning cover design.
