The application has been equipped with a number of functions that enable convenient designing, sketching and dimensioning of objects, as well as creating extensive technical documentation for many popular industry (including construction, automation, energy, telecommunications, etc.). CAD Drawing has a collection of libraries of ready objects used in projects of electrical installations, ventilation, water supply, air conditioning, central heating and alarm systems.
 
 The program allows you to import ready-made projects in DXF format and their subsequent export to other CAD programs.
 
 The most important functions of the program
 
 
 possibility of immediate (after pointing with the mouse) transfer of dimensions to the Norma program
 quick drawing of two-dimensional drawings (eg sketches, plans, projections, elevations)
 automatic dimensioning according to any parameters specified by the user (different types of lines and dimensioning texts)
 libraries of ready objects used in electrical, ventilation, water, air-conditioning, central heating and alarm installations
 the use of fill libraries and the ability to create user libraries
 automatic calculation of the measurement (eg surface, perimeter, thickness of objects, rooms, buildings)
 importing BMP and JPG files (eg foundation, building, project)
 printing a project on any printer in any format
 adjusting the format and orientation of the page, scale, unit of measurement to the individual needs of the user
 work on many projects at the same time
 layer management: adding, deleting, merging, merging, modifying and moving any layers of the project
 application of various drawing tools: any line types, polylines, rectangles, circles, ellipses, arcs, inserting texts and symbols
 modifying objects: rotating, copying, cutting, pasting, moving, changing display order, mirroring, scaling, several dozen font types and several million colors
 any grouping and ungrouping of objects and symbols
 use of many editing functions for one object or group of objects (object parameters, object features, envelope, completion)
 the use of a formula editor to calculate the value of measurements, the use of mathematical formulas
 displaying a grid with a given density in the form of points or lines, the function of snapping to the grid and objects
 display description for each used function
 using the "undo - restore" function and automatic backup
 cooperation with other CAD programs (reading and saving projects in DXF format)
 export of measurements to the cost estimate program Norma
