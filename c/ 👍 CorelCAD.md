> CorelCAD is a program that Corel has entered the market for computer-aided design software. CorelCAD fully supports the popular DWG format, and we'll find all the tools and functions needed for 2D and 3D design. In addition, Corel has introduced several innovative features, such as the ability to include handwritten and voice notes in the project (available only on Windows) and compatibility with CorelDRAW and Corel DESIGNER.

Supported file formats
 
 The main advantage of CorelCAD is the ability to work with files saved in DWG format, containing both 2D and 3D models. The DWG format is the native CorelCAD format, but the program also supports DXF and DWF files used by AutoCAD 2010 and later. For compatibility with older software, CorelCAD allows you to save and read R12 DWG and DXF formats. In some cases, it is also possible to restore damaged DWG and DXF files in different versions. Projects can also be exported to portable PDF and SVG formats, and in addition for the Windows version of this program, plug-ins have been created that allow exporting projects for CorelDRAW (CDR) and Corel DESIGNER (CDS).
 
 User Interface
 
 The CorelCAD work environment has been prepared so that users of other computer-aided design programs can easily find it. There are tools typical for this type of program, a command line that supports popular command aliases, and the layout of menu items and tools on the straps will make every designer feel comfortable. In addition, the work accelerates the contextual shortcut menu invoked with the right mouse button, and a very useful property palette. The palette gives quick access to the attributes of the entity, such as the color and style of the line, and more advanced, such as the layer on which the entity is located, or the details of its location. Interface configurations can be saved and switched between them during operation. In addition, you can create your own aliases for frequently used commands, 
 
 2D design
 
 When designing in two dimensions, the high precision of matching objects is provided by intelligent tools such as attracting entities, information about the object under the cursor and guides. To facilitate the moving of entities, CorelCAD has handles that allow you to move entities along the selected axis and convenient scaling, duplicating and changing position. An interesting fact is the ability to work in a coordinate system that you define, which is particularly helpful if it is more convenient to operate on axes parallel to the planes. 
 
 3D modeling
 
 Three-dimensional models can be viewed in viewports or in an interactive three-dimensional view, where the model can be rotated in real time. Viewers can be placed on one screen to present the model from side, top, front, back or bottom, and in isometric view in one of four directions. The model can be presented in shaded form or as a full render. The library of basic solids ( primitives), on which you can perform logical operations (sum, difference, common part) to modify their shapes. Solids can also be created from two-dimensional entities by extrusion, wrapping the surface around an axis, or by creating the stretching of solid walls between two two-dimensional entities. Models can also be imported and exported to ACIS format files (SAT files).
 
 
 Extending and automation
 
 Users of CorelCAD on Windows can use the plug-ins available in the Corel electronic store. In addition, the program has a special interface for automating tasks that can be programmed with LISP or Microsoft Visual Studio Tools for Applications (VSTA). This allows you to create new procedures and your own plugins.
