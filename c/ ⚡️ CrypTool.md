> CrypTool is a free and open tool, thanks to which anyone interested can get acquainted with the operation of algorithms and cryptographic protocols. The program allows, for example, encryption and decryption using modern solutions such as AES, but also testing classical ciphers as a Caesar key. The tool also allows cryptographic analysis.

The application uses in its interface a ribbon known from the Microsoft Office suite, its service should not be difficult. By default, a wizard is launched, thanks to which we can select the operations we are interested in. They have been grouped into coding / decoding (including encryption), cryptanalysis, shortcut functions, math functions, various types of code, as well as additional tools. Thanks to CrypTool, we can get to know classic algorithms like: Cezar, Vigenere, XOR, Scytale, Enigma, ADFGVX and Transposition crypts.
 
 The application also allows you to check much newer, currently used solutions such as AES, DES, SDES, Twofish, TEA and RC2, as well as an asymmetric solution in the form of RSA. The program allows you to precisely configure the parameters of algorithms and input data, in addition to the wizard, it also allows you to design systems dealing with cryptography (eg downloading data from the camera, their encryption, etc.). Among the available shortcut functions, you can use MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, RPEMD160, Tiger and Whirlpool. CrypTool also offers the ability to encode text between different formats, eg from ASCII to Base64, from UTF-32 to binary values, etc. It is possible to check even the Morse code entry.
 
 Additional tools built into the program allow for fast password protection (encryption with AES), checking their strength based on various determinants such as entropy, KeePass, Mozilla indicator, etc. In additional tools we will also find a subroutine for server analysis for vulnerability of Heartbleed vulnerability, and also generating random numeric strings. The application allows, among others using OpenCL, installing additional components, and configuring settings. A Polish language version is also available.
 
 Attention!
 There is also an older version from branch 1.x available for download. Its interface differs significantly from the new CrypTool, just like the functions offered. Most of them are available in both versions, however CrypTool 1.x is no longer officially developed and does not receive any updates.
