All functions offered by CyberLink ActionDirector are available at your fingertips without having to "click through" between successive screens to find the options you need. Noteworthy is also fast video editing with a single button and an extremely neat, modern and at the same time clear user interface.
 
 The tool allows you to quickly place objects in the so-called a storyboard that is an alternative to the standard edition of the timeline. CyberLink ActionDirector uses a drag-and-drop technique that makes adding new video fragments or effects easily and quickly.
 
 CyberLink ActionDirector allows you to edit your recordings in 4K resolution, which in turn allows developers to create incredibly detailed videos. The program allows you to import images recorded with a smoothness of 120 or even 240 frames per second and export video of the same quality in order to achieve a smooth slow-motion effect in your materials.
 
 It is worth noting that we can attach an audio track to any video created using CyberLink ActionDirector. All you have to do is import the selected music piece, and then use the easy-to-use tools that allow you to adjust the sound volume to your needs.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
