Currently, it's a minimalistic extension to Google Chrome, which, when you open a new tab in your browser, displays a digital clock and weather forecast in it. The user can independently set the color of the presented data.

The add-on supports the Polish language, thanks to which most elements of the simple interface (days of the week in the weather forecast and the city) are correctly displayed and translated. Only the fact why the producer did not decide to translate the main date directly below the clock is a wonder.
 
 It is worth noting that in addition to the option of manually changing the color scheme, background colors can also change automatically, for example depending on the temperature or time of day. However, this requires additional options, using a micropayment system for this purpose.
