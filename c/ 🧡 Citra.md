The emulator offers a full-screen game, a simple debugger, a hardware renderer and a JIT compiler for shaders, making it fast and efficient. Emulated games can be run at higher than native resolutions, up to 4000 × 2,400 pixels. Sound is also played correctly.
 The program is able to run practically all homebrew applications and games, as well as many commercial games, including The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D, Animal Crossing: New Leaf, Sonic Generations, or Pokémon Sun and Moon.
