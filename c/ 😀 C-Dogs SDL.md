> C-Dogs SDL is a free old-style shooter game, when in the days of the magnificence of 2D games nobody has ever thought about three dimensions. It was enough, as a modern projection from above for action, and for the diversification and inconvenience of the so-called fog of war, that is, the hero could not see what obscured his surroundings. The former silent hit was finally released as an open source project, which allowed for its improvement and development of production.

Fun can take place on several people in front of one computer or within one of the many campaigns available here. Faithfully recreated, among other things, the stages from the iconic Doom. The gameplay is of course to eliminate enemies. We modify the appearance of our own tough guy, we choose him armament, and then we go to battle. The eye is especially pleasing to pixel-based graphic effects from DOS.
 
 
 Not everyone, of course, has such an archaic style to fit in, the creators thought about image enhancements. High resolutions are supported. You can choose a simple scaling, so the binding does not lose its original charm, or one of the options for smoothing the image. C-Dogs is great for home computer geek tournaments. It provides great entertainment, sweet chaos and unforgettable actions.
