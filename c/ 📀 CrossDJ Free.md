The program interface is almost identical to other applications of this type. The main screen consists of two extensive players, a convenient mixer, playlists for playing and viewing multimedia files, as well as tools for creating sounds and mixing music. CrossDJ Free integrates with the iTunes application and has a built-in music album browser.
 
 
 The program also includes a 3-band equalizer for improving the sound quality, frequency (tone) manipulator, various modes for accelerating and slowing the tempo of the music being played, as well as a BPM analyzer for measuring the speed of sound. CrossDJ Free also has an automatic music quality indicator and a special tool for synchronizing bits.
 Attention!
  CrossDJ Free is available for free, but compared to the commercial version it does not have a sound recording function and offers a limited amount of visual effects.
