> CryEngine Free SDK is a set of tools designed to create 2D and 3D games for platforms such as PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U and PCs with a Windows system. The engine based on which the productions are made is characterized by excellent performance and a very realistic projection of lights.

Work with the editor included in the CryEngine Free SDK takes place in the WYSIWYG mode. This means that the user can see their results in real time in the editor window by entering all changes. Building the world is done using the drag and drop method. The CryEngine engine is designed to create both indoor and outdoor elements, but it is in the case of creating open spaces that it develops the largest wings. CryEngine Free SDK is definitely one of the best tools for the production of commercial games and cinema animations in the world.
 
 The program was used, among others to create the game Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2, for which the Polish City Interactive studio is responsible. In addition, the CryEngine engine's full potential can also be seen in such games as Crysis 3, Homefront 2, Project Heart and Soul, Everybody's Gone to the Rapture or Nexuiz.
