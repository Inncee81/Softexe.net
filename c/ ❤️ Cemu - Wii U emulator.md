In return, we get the ability to run games smoothly even in 4K resolution (although it's better to have 1080 Ti). The DRC (GamePad), Pro Controller and Classic Controller controllers are also emulated, the keyboard and USB controllers are partially supported.
 
 Currently, with Cedu you can run without any defects a dozen or so games, about 50 titles work well, including titles such as Xenoblade X or Bayonetta 2, in future versions it will be possible to even launch The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
