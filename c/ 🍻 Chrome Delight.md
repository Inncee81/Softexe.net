```sh
Chrome Delight is an addition to Google Chrome, thanks to which, after launching a new tab in the browser, each time we will see a short, looped stop frame animation of an interesting landscape. There is also weather preview and shortcuts for applications, history and bookmarks.

In principle, the extension does not require any configuration to work, but interested parties have the opportunity to use several key settings. First of all, you can set the town where the weather will apply, but also affect the appearance of the new card window.
 
 If necessary, you can, for example, completely disable the shortcuts and the weather, and the default animation will be deprived of autoplay, so that instead of the movie only its first frame, and therefore the picture will be presented. It is worth noting that the animations are quickly loaded, so the supplement does not seem sluggish.
