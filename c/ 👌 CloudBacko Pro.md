In the case of CloudBacko Pro, a clear interface based on fashionable tiles known for example from the Windows 10 operating system deserves attention. By default, the user can perform a back-up of the desktop content as well as the Documents and Favorites folders, but there is no obstacle to selecting the data yourself what will be in the backup. It is also worth mentioning that the application also includes a restore function.
 
 When using CloudBacko Pro, do not be afraid that important documents will fall into the wrong hands. In the program settings, we can define a password without which the described tool can not be started. There is also an option to send reports related to the backup to the indicated e-mail address.
 
 CloudBacko Pro offers the possibility of manual backup, but in addition it can work in accordance with a predetermined schedule by making a back-up of data, for example, once a week.
