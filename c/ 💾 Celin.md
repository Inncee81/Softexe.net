Celin first of all allows the edition of SAD documents, although this edition is possible in a way developed in the Celina system, not a SAD paper document. The program does not contain editing forms modeled on paper versions, but forms adapted to a much larger range of information in the Celina system. Similarly, NCTS and Intrastat documents must be completed.
 
 In addition to document registration, it allows a fully defined printing of information contained in the database on paper. The software includes several XML document templates (for Celina, NCTS and Intrastat systems) that you can modify or create new ones. All customs declarations are based on the customs tariff, which the program automatically updates as part of the ISZTAR system.Attention!
 
 1. In order to update the tariff data within the ISZTAR system, the company must be registered in this system in order to receive a login and password. 
 
 2. The program is free in the version for one position.
