The program offers functionality that allows even novice webmasters to create websites that take full advantage of the opportunities offered by modern technologies. In addition to the basic functions allowing for working in cards with multiple files at the same time, syntax coloring, autocompleting code, etc., it also has many options that will be appreciated by those who take their first steps with HTML and CSS. I am talking about the marker library, which allows you to browse them along with available attributes, as well as inserting in a selected place in the code by clicking the mouse.
 
 CoffeeCup Free HTML Editor gives the user the ability to create new websites from scratch and using or on the basis of ready-made templates. With the help of the editor, we can also edit previously created websites, even if they have already been published on the server. The program allows real-time preview of the effects of our work, and thanks to the integration with the S-Drive platform, also for the free publication of the website online.
 
 Attention!
 
 For 21 days from the installation of the program, it offers full functionality of the commercial version. After this period, some options are blocked.
