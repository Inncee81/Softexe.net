> Chrome Password Decrypter is a very useful tool for Google Chrome web browser users. It allows you to instantly recover lost passwords stored in the application's memory.

It is extremely important that the Chrome Password Decrypter is also addressed to less experienced recipients, because all recovered information is displayed in text form (naturally only after decrypting them). This means that to avoid losing data in the future or transferring passwords between computers, you can save them in one of the possible formats: HTML, XML or TXT.
 
 Chrome Password Decrypter offers one more additional functionality. It allows for generating a summary of visited web sites with the so-called blacklist to which the user has forgotten the login passwords, previously defining in the Google Chrome options the function of memorizing the password when visiting these websites.
