```sh
Create Synchronicity is a small but very useful application for synchronizing files and backing up user data.
```

After starting Create Synchronicity, create a user profile and then define the basic settings. I am talking about choosing the source path and the target path and how to synchronize files (mirrored, incremental or double-sided increment). From the interface it is also possible to attach or exclude specific files.
 
 Create Synchronicity allows for "manual" execution of operations or in accordance with a predetermined schedule (eg once a week at a specified time). After synchronizing files, there is an option to read the event log.
