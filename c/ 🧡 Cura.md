> Cura is an open program for preparing models for printing on 3D printers. The program was created thanks to the efforts of Ultimaker, which also produces printers.

The program was prepared primarily for generating files for Ultimaker printers, but you can also prepare files for Lulzbot, Printrbot and universal printers for RepRap, MakerBot, Witbox and other printers with the help of predefined profiles. 
 
 
 The program can generate a file based on the provided model. In the settings, you can choose the type of supports, the thickness of the printing layer, the size and type of stands that stabilize the model ( raft , brim , skirt ), filling, type of structure and the like. You can also scale, rotate and bounce the model relative to the axis. 
 
 
 In the program, you can also automatically fix some errors, such as intersecting planes or non-closed polygons. On the preview, you can view the printing layers, auxiliary structures and place the model in the right place of the chamber. 
 
 
 Before downloading the program, you must complete a short survey, but you can refuse to provide information.
