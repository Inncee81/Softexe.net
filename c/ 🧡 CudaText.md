The program supports over 160 various programming languages, including the most popular ones, namely: C, C ++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, Python and XML. Similarly to many other applications of this type, CudaText also allows you to use the syntax highlighting function, which allows us to quickly detect any errors.
 
 CudaText offers the opportunity to work with multiple documents at the same time. The main window of the application can be divided into several smaller ones, but you have to keep in mind that working in this mode is not comfortable in a situation where we have a small screen monitor.
