The program is based on the Chromium project, a free open source browser based on which Google Chrome is also built. Apart from the application itself, we can also find extensions in the package, which are used to block unwanted elements on websites and prevent them from being snooped on the network. Some extensions are available from the top bar of the browser, allowing you to get, for example, a detailed report on the safety of a given site, or view a list of items blocked when loading a page.
 
 In addition, Comodo Chromodo Private Internet Browser is simply a web browser, deliberately reminiscent - and for good reason - Google Chrome. We will not find any revolutionary solutions here, nor any oddly arranged elements, and any Chrome or Chromium user will easily find it in this browser. The program is rather an interesting alternative to the two mentioned solutions, which may be of interest mainly to those who pay more attention to the issue of security and privacy in the network.
