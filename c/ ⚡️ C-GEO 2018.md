> C-GEO is continuously developed since 1994, a universal and very popular tool supporting the work of surveyors and designers.

The program copes well with most of the calculations encountered in geodesy, ie technical leveling, tachymetry, indents (angular, linear, backward, spatial, with alignment, combined), intersections (straight lines, straight lines, etc.), plots and UAE, settlement of parcels in plots, divisions of plots for a given area, polygon sequences, domains, projections, polar calculations, polar stake out, angles / sides / directions logs, Helmerta / afiniczna coordinate transformations, between WGS / 65/2000/92 / local systems ), regulation of gantries, etc.
 
 Other C-GEO functions include unlimited base of geodetic coordinates (with geodesic sketch database), which can be freely shaped by the user (eg by adding new fields to the database) and an integrated numerical map with a coordinate base and calculation modules. Additional tool modules available in the system are symbol, form and code editors, user's mapping templates, GIS file viewer allowing to read SHP / SWDE / MIF / GML files.
 
 C-GEO is compliant with current MAiC regulations. The system works with FOOIF, Geodimeter, GeoMAX, Hi-Target, Leica, Nikon, Sokkia, South, Stonex, Topcon, Trimble, Pentax, Zeiss and other stations. The program also reads data from the Leica NA, Sprinter, Sokkia SDL, Topcon DL and Trimble DiNi code levels.
