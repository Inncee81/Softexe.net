> Clover is a small tool that extends Windows Explorer to support a card mechanism known from Internet browsers. With its help, it becomes possible to work with many folders or ZIP archives in one standard window.

The tool fully integrates with the Windows shell, allowing the user to perform many useful operations on the cards representing different locations on the system or on the local disk. Among the possibilities of this small extension we find a useful function of pinning selected cards, duplicating them, closing all but active cards and restoring previously closed cards.
 
 In addition, Clover offers the possibility to create a list of bookmarks, to which we can add, for example, cards with frequently used folders. The tool also supports keyboard shortcuts that further improve the work of cards.
