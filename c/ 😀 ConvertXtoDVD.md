The application supports the majority of popular video formats (AVI, DivX, XviD, MOV, MKV, FLV, MPEG1, MPEG2, MPEG-, NSV, DVR-MS, TS, IFO, VOB, ASF, WMV, RealMedia, RM, RMVB, OGM and files from digital cameras, images captured from TV, etc.), audio (AC3, DTS, PCM, OGG, MP3, WMA) and subtitles (SRT, SUB / IDX, SSA). The operation of the program is very simple and although it offers many advanced options, it should not cause any problems to anyone. With a few clicks, it is possible to create DVD material from selected video files, which can then be burned on the disc directly from the application.
 
 In addition, ConvertXtoDVD can also create DVD menus with ready-made templates (which of course can be edited), build chapters (manual or automatic division), adjust sound volume, support PAL and NTSC standards and allow selection of output image size (widescreen 16: 9, full screen 4: 3, etc.)
