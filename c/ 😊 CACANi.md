With the help of the described tool, we will be able to "revive" your work, which we will use, for example, in short or full-size movies, online commercials or many other places. CACANi is addressed both to novice artists and more experienced users who will appreciate a number of useful options and a very intuitive interface.
 
 Due to the use of vector graphics, CACANi allows you to export the animation in any resolution (low-quality preview files are easier to share with the client, and the final version of a large size can be placed, for example, on FTP). Before this happens, however, we will have to prepare it, working on the layers of a given file, creating individual frames of the given animation. To make it easier to navigate, we can assign colored markers to different layers to switch between them if necessary.
 
 CACANi includes a proprietary, intelligent painting system for individual frames. Thanks to it, the program will paint individual frames of a given animation based on information contained in one painted frame. This is just one of many examples of the described tool, thanks to which users preparing much more extensive works will be able to save a lot of time, allocating it even to create more drawings.
