> Chemix .NET (formerly Chemix) is an application that provides all the tools needed to learn chemistry at various levels (in primary school, middle school, high school). We will find here a compendium of knowledge and modules for performing calculations when solving tasks or working in a laboratory.

In the program, of course, we will find the necessary Mendeleev table, but with additional possibilities - element search, sorting according to selected criteria and tables with additional information that can be copied to the clipboard or printed immediately. It is accompanied by typical chemical tables, where we can find typical tables of density, solubility, the scale of electronegativity and additional curiosities, including historical ones, as well as biographies of well-deserving chemists. The information part closes the chemical dictionary with the search engine and the possibility of presenting related entries. 
 
 
 The available tools supporting calculations are: unit converter, laboratory calculators for molar masses and concentrations, and a set of tools for operating with gas transformation equations. The whole is complemented by an openGL browser of molecular structures, presenting them in three dimensions. 
 Attention!
 The license allows for free use of the program (except for commercial applications).
