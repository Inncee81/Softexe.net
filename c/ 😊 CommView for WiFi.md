CommView for WiFi is a special version of CommView created for capturing and analyzing network packets in 802.11 a / b / g / n wireless networks. It receives information from the wireless network adapter and decodes the analyzed data. 

With the help of the program, you can see the list of network connections, IP statistics and explore individual packets. Packets can be decrypted using custom WEP or WPA-PSK keys and decoded down to the lowest level with full analysis of common protocols.

Provides full access to raw data. Intercepted packets can be saved to a file for further analysis. The flexible filter system allows you to discard unwanted packets or intercept only those packets that you want.

Customizable alerts allow you to report important events to the user, such as suspicious packets, high network load or unknown addresses. 

Supporting more than 70 protocols, this tool allows you to thoroughly examine captured packets using a convenient, tree-like system for displaying protocol levels and packet headers. In addition, the product provides an open interface for connecting protocol decoding modules developed by a third party. 

CommView for WiFi is a full-featured and affordable tool for wireless network administrators, network security experts, network programmers, or those who want to see the full picture of traffic on a wireless network.
