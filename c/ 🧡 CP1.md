```sh
CP1 is a small program that will allow graphic designers and webmasters to manage colors more easily. The application is a palette of colors, displaying hexadecimal (HEX) and RGB recordings of any color previously taken with a dropper. It also has a built-in memory of recent activities, thanks to which it is possible to quickly create a color palette that appears on a specific graphic by downloading the fragments one by one with the dropper and then checking all the palette that has been created.

When we retrieve the selected color, it is displayed in the first window in the list. The other elements are filled with other shades of the same color to suggest interesting opportunities to develop the project in terms of using the same color, but in a different shade on the website or blog.
 
 A built-in option to export the created palette to a TXT text file or in accordance with the JSON format turns out to be a very convenient solution. This will greatly simplify the work of programmers who will not have to waste too much time manually copying color symbols into the code of the application being created.
