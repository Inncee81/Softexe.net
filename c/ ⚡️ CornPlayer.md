After launching CornPlayer, the main program window appears on the screen, which contains access to all the most important options. With a few clicks we will launch the selected video material or sound file located on your hard disk, portable memory or any other data medium (eg disc). The application is also great for playing videos saved on YouTube and allows you to download them (in the form of a video or sound file).
 
 CornPlayer offers the opportunity to create your own playlist, so that in the blink of an eye we will gain access to the necessary materials. In this way, you can easily launch your favorite songs or music videos both in full screen and in a window, the size of which can be freely set.
 
 The CornPlayer program interface is very clear and intuitive. The application contains basic options that can also be found in other multimedia players: pausing, moving to the previous or next material, adjusting the volume and launching new files using the drag and drop technique.
