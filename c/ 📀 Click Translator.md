After installing the Click Translator, just select the text (it can be in the selected document, on the website or any other place), and then use the keyboard shortcut predefined so that the translation appears in the cloud. It should be added that translations can be saved to the clipboard, and all program logs should be saved in a separate file.
 
 Click Translator, like many other tools of this type, is not perfect. Therefore, it is worth bearing in mind that the program will adequately translate individual words, but when we want to translate the whole sentence, we will get it in the language indicated, but the syntax and grammar may leave much to be desired. Nevertheless, we should understand the context anyway.
