In Manga Studio we have various types of freehand drawing pens, several types of nibs and finishes for contours, paints and colored pencils, airbrushes, several elastics, as well as stamps with characteristic patterns. The behavior of the tools is close to their natural patterns, so you can mix paints, smudge pencils, and calligraphy. 
 
 
 In addition, the program can use vector shapes, fills, gradients and automatically generated shadows. The program can import 3D models and scanned sketches that will be used when composing the frame. You can also reach for rulers and forms that allow you to divide a website in various ways. 
 
 
 The same program installation allows you to test for 30 days, without the ability to save and export work, Manga Studio and Manga Studio EX. The program versions have different options and prices.
