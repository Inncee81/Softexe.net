The tool allows you to crop, crop and rotate graphics, allows you to change their size or quality, and even create a mirror image of your image. There is also the option to remove red eye in selected pictures. If we have panoramic photographs, we can divide them into several smaller graphics.
 
 The program described is characterized by a very transparent interface modeled on the GUI known from the Microsoft Office package, thanks to which its users will immediately locate the necessary options. cPicture is ideal for creating a slide show and preparing photo albums.
