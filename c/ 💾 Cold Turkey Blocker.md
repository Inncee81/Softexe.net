Thanks to the features offered by this application, we will be able to focus entirely on the work. Cold Turkey Blocker is available as an extension to the web browser (it does not work with Internet Explorer and Edge), which allows you to block access to everything that distracts us in the performance of duties on the computer. These can be websites, applications, notifications and more.
 
 If we do not want to use the option of a long-term blockade, Cold Turkey Blocker can be used as an application using the pomodoro technique, whose assumptions are based on taking 5-minute breaks every 25 minutes of work. This means that we will be able to gain access to blocked content once every half hour (it is possible to exclude from this rule the pages that we need at work).
 
 Cold Turkey Blocker can be configured manually, but nothing prevents the program from operating in accordance with a predetermined schedule. It is worth remembering that the application blocks the indicated content, to which access will be obtained only after the time has elapsed.
