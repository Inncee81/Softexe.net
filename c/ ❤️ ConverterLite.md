This small program converts files saved in MP3 format to AC3, MP4, OGG, WAV and WMV (we can also change the MP4 to MP3 format). ConverterLite also copes with video materials, allowing you to convert MPEG, FLV, F4V and MOV to AVI. Materials prepared in this way can be easily put in the memory of the selected mobile device, such as an Android smartphone, iPad, iPhone, PlayStation Portable or Blackberry.
 
 ConverterLite also contains a built-in application for burning files to CDs or DVDs, which can be especially useful in a situation where selected songs saved in, for example, MP3 format, we want to put on one of these media, then listen to them using the player mounted in the car .
