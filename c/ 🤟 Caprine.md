> Caprine is a desktop messaging tool for Messenger Facebook, which offers exactly the same features as the official application for sharing to the site members founded by Mark Zuckerberg, but also includes a number of additional options.

As you can guess, Caprine mainly allows you to send and receive messages, make video calls, share files (e.g., photos, videos, documents), add emails to your entries, and so on, and so on. This does not mean, however, that the program imitates Facebook Messenger in one hundred percent because it has several unique features.
 
 Caprine takes care of the safety of people using this tool. The special private mode allows you to disable user activity tracking based on links provided during a conversation. If we click on the link to the online bookstore, we will not have to worry about the personalized advertising of books on the main Facebook page.
 
 Caprine users have the option of modifying the main graphic theme to dark, they can also change the font size, and use keyboard shortcuts to perform various operations faster (eg starting a new conversation, adding graphic files, deleting messages or searching for selected content).
