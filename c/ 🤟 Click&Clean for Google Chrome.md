Thanks to this inconspicuous plugin, we will increase our security during everyday work with a computer connected to the Network. It offers a full set of tools, with the help of which we do not have to worry about the fact that another computer user, for example, suspects the list of websites we browse. In addition, Click &amp; Clean has a positive impact on the performance of the Google Chrome browser. Systematic use of the extension causes, among others faster start up and display of web resources, not to mention the released resources on the hard disk occupied by unnecessary files.
 
 Click &amp; Clean has been equipped with options for cleaning all private data (browsing and downloading history, cache, saved passwords, application cache, indexed databases, cookies, saved form data and others), including a convenient self-cleaning when closing the browser. From the level of the extension, we also get easy access to many often hidden options of the Google Chrome browser. There was also a built-in safe password generator.
