The distinguishing feature of the application is the option of dividing the translated documents into fragments, according to the user's preferences: according to paragraphs, lines, sentences or own tags. An additional advantage is the separate glossaries for each of the projects, thanks to which it is possible to conveniently collect definitions of terms that will often be used in translation.
 
 Although the program can be used to translate individual words or sentences, due to the many options associated with longer publications, it will probably be better suited as an interpreter for whole articles or documents. The application can open most popular file formats, including TXT and Microsoft Office documents, LibreOffice, PDF files, AutoCAD and more. You can also translate texts read straight from the system clipboard.
