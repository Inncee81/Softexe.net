```sh
CPU-M Benchmark is a small application for testing processors.
```
[![CPU-M Benchmark](https://gallery.dpcdn.pl/imgc/Tools/84799/g_-_420x350_1.5_-_x059f94ef-b6c1-4277-9bc9-3d0b5c85d1eb.jpg)](https://softexe.net/win/system/diagnostics-tests/cpu-m-benchmark:ahbd.html)

The operation of the program is based on a very simple principle. From the main CPU-M Benchmark window, all you need to do is specify the number of threads and cores (by default, one thread and all cores), and then click "start benchmark test". The results will be presented in a punctual form after a while. The tool also shows the degree of CPU and memory usage. In addition, we will find in it additional, advanced options showing the properties of your processor and RAM. 
 
 The CPU-M Benchmark also contains the history of the tests carried out. We can therefore get acquainted with the results we have obtained in the past. Importantly, individual results are presented in the form of a clear table, from which we will find out whether we tested the entire processor, or only selected cores or threads, and - of course - we will recall the result of the previous benchmark.
