Among the many advantages of the FREE variation, there are two different data compression algorithms to reduce the volume of the final executable file and the ability to register ActiveX libraries, fonts or entries in the system registry. CreateInstall also offers standard options such as creating shortcuts for files / folders in the Start menu and on the system desktop, setting your own icons and background visible in the installer, saving data to INI files, running at the end of the installation of a specific file or automatically creating an uninstaller of our program .
 
 It is worth noting that the installation scripts were written in the free, not very popular Gentee programming language.
