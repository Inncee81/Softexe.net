> Caliber is a "Swiss officer's knife" for modern bookworms using tablets and readers. Caliber not only provides convenient tools for viewing, organizing and converting digital books, but also allows you to create books from content provided by RSS feeds.

Book management in Caliber is like working with a typical multimedia library. Files in PDF, RTF, ePub, FB2, LIT, MOBI, PDB, TXT and many other formats are added to the collection (copied to a computer disk), from which you can view them (relative to authors, publishers, ratings, titles or cycles) and edit the metadata and convert to one of the supported formats. It is worth paying attention to the advanced conversion possibilities of this program. Here we can configure the appearance of the output documents, define the font size, and select the target size of the display of the electronic reader for which the book is prepared. In addition, you can analyze the structure of the document and provide an elegant division into chapters, automatically create a table of contents and heuristic analysis of the text, what unifies formatting (removing empty lines between paragraphs, correct line wrapping, removing unnecessary dashes remaining after moving words, etc.) and defining your own metadata reading schemes based on the file name when importing. The program uses expressions to analyze and define formattingXPath (XML Path Language).   
 
 Caliber is not only books, because it has a feature that is rarely seen in programs of this type - it is an RSS reader. Caliber has the ability to download articles from a defined list of sources once a day and then export in the form of a "digestible" document for your reader or tablet, which you can read without an Internet connection. At the beginning of the document there is a summary, which at first glance is no different from the content presented by the RSS reader. Below the article headlines there are links to the relevant pages in the document where the full versions of the texts are.
 
 
 
 Often the quality of the displayed fonts can be improved using the Microsoft ClearType Tuner .
