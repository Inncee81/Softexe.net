The CD Recovery Toolbox Free software is very easy to use, which is mainly due to a clear graphical interface that guides the user step-by-step throughout the entire data recovery process. Work with the restore wizard starts with indicating the drive where the damaged disk is located and defining the location where the recovered files will be saved. The next step is to analyze the contents of the media and to indicate by the user the elements (files and / or folders) to be restored.
 
 The tool is characterized by high speed of operation, which, of course, depends on the type and level of damage. It copes well with the recovery of both small files, as well as those whose size exceeds 4 GB.
