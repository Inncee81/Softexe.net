CyberGhost VPN is a program for anonymous use of the Internet. This application will allow you to be invisible in the network and hide your data when visiting various sites and resources, which ensures complete confidentiality and security.

This service will provide an opportunity to visit as usual any sites and pages on the Internet, but the real IP-address will be changed, and the traffic consumed will pass through the server programs located in different countries of Europe and the USA. In this case, all data sent from the computer is encrypted, and the connection between the computer and CyberGhost is protected by reliable tools that hide all data from outside interference when using public wireless WLAN networks, unprotected Wi-Fi access points or working in an Internet cafe. Thus, all Internet user applications are protected.

To start working with the service, you must first register on the program website, then log in to the program with your registration data and start the IP address spoofing mechanism.
