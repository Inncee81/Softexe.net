> OCCT (OverClock Checking Tool) is very appreciated among the so-called oveclockers a tool to test the underlying computer components that have been "overclocked" to achieve the highest possible performance. It also provides detailed information, including about your processor.

During its operation, the program subjects the computer to a high load, while providing the ability to monitor the basic properties of its basic components - the level of CPU and RAM usage, voltage and temperature of individual cores and the GPU unit (if the equipment is equipped with appropriate sensors). Four types of tests are available to the user: author's and using the Intel LINPACK library for processor testing, as well as benchmarks that check the graphics card for rendering 3D objects and the power supply. In the case of the latter, both the processor and the GPU are subjected to the load. All of the available benchmarks can be configured to a greater or lesser extent.
 
 After completing the tests, OCCT generates a set of several graphs, which are saved on the disk in the form of PNG files. They illustrate the use of the temperature of individual CPU cores and GPUs during the processor and graphics card, as well as the voltage.Attention!
 The program requires .NET Framework libraries installed in version 2.0 or newer. The latest version of the .NET Framework can be downloaded in the section PROGRAMS -&gt; Add-ons -&gt; Libraries and other add-ons (see: Related Programs).
 
 For the correct operation of the program, the latest (supported by the graphics card) version of DirectX is required. It is available for download in the section PROGRAMS -&gt; Multimedia -&gt; Multimedia extensions and codecs (see: Related Programs).
 
 A portable version is also available for download, which does not require installation in the system and is ready for use right after downloading.
