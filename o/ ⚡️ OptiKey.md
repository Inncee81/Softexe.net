> OptiKey is a free screen keyboard for the Windows operating system that allows you to enter text using your eyes and turn it into a spoken word. The tool was created for disabled users suffering from ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) or MND (motor neuron disease).

OptiKey requires the device to track eye movements, but it is worth noting that the application manufacturer took care of compatibility with relatively cheap eye-trackers. In this way the author wants to simultaneously fight with high prices of commercial and difficult to use products available on the market in everyday use. Therefore, it provides the effects of its several years of work completely free of charge.
 
 OptiKey was created by default to cooperate with eye-trackers, but if we do not have such a device, we can also install the program and then use it with the mouse or webcam. Regardless of the variant of the work, the described tool is an alternative to the physical keyboard, which allows you to enter text in any program.
 
 In addition, OptiKey can also replace the mouse. Just return to the main screen and select the "rodent" icon, then look at the icons at the top to perform the action (eg left-click).
