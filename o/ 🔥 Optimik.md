Optimik allows you to enter projects and orders to the base, along with all the necessary materials, such as putties, angles, tapes and the like. After entering the order, you can prepare optimal cuts, which will save material, optimize cuts and estimate the time of order execution. Production orders can be exported with files for CNC machines.
 
 Optimik has the function of creating a block of elements for cutting, which are particularly useful for designing drawer or sliding doors with a preserved pattern of rings. An interesting function that furniture manufacturers will appreciate is the possibility of parametric product creation. 
 
 
 In addition, Optimik allows you to run a database of business partners, i.e. contractors, subcontractors and material suppliers, along with settlements with different VAT rates for services and materials. The program also allows group work on a single basis. 
 
 
 The free version of Optimik allows you to create cutting plans with up to 30 parts, allows you to have 15 items in stock and 5 business partners in one database. Larger versions have Hobby and Workman versions. The most advanced, professional, there are no restrictions and allows you to export cut plans to CSV files.
