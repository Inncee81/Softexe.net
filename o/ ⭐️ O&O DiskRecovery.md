If you use the default tools of the Windows operating system after you delete files from the hard disk and the trash, you lose your access to them forever. Occasionally, however, there may be a situation where we removed an important document, holiday photos or any other important and valuable data - then we should use O &amp; O DiskRecovery, which will recover lost files very quickly and easily.
 
 O &amp; O DiskRecovery is addressed to both less and more experienced users. It contains an easy-to-use wizard, thanks to which we can recover files quickly and easily (before performing a recovery operation, we can preview files that we intend to restore). The tool supports over 350 different file formats and has no restrictions on file restoration - we can recover any amount of data.
 
 It is worth adding that O &amp; O DiskRecovery supports any hard disk model compatible with Windows. The program can also be used after losing data stored on a removable disk, USB stick or memory card.
