We will find here classic tools, such as a pencil, a calligraphy pen, watercolors, pastels and oil paints. You can also create your own brushes by changing the parameters supplied with the program or using a bitmap as a brush. Interestingly, this program has the ability to color in a way typical for comics, that is, with a raster pattern typical for printing. openCanvas offers a wide range of raster shape configuration options, including unusual patterns such as circles, and quite a wide range of standard options: rhomboids, dots, circles, chessboard, grid, lines, etc. openCanvas works very well with a pen tablet. The tools used in the program are pressure-sensitive, so drawing in it is very natural. If you are drawing with the mouse, it is worth using the version introduced in version 5 a system that facilitates drawing curves (it is activated by brush settings). 
 
 Among the editing tools, of course, there are various types of selection (rectangle, ellipse, polygon and lasso), known from other graphic programs magic wand, fill, gradient, and combination of selection with filling, which automatically fills the area immediately after selection. We also have a text tool, a magnifying glass, a mask (framing) and a color sampler. The great advantage of openCanvas is the ability to work on layers and use masks. The whole is complemented by a set of basic effects (noise, blur, mosaic, etc.) and filters modifying the image (levels, color balance, brightness, contrast) and classic distortion.
 
 In search of inspiration, it is worth visiting the openCanvas user gallery . You can also find "Event" files specific to this program - files with registered progress of creating a given illustration. It can be invaluable help in learning to draw. Of course, each user can record and share their own events. In addition, playback progress can be viewed on users' websites via the Flash player.
