The program allows you to delete data in several ways to be sure that deleted files will not be recovered even by professional companies. In addition to the ability to delete typical files, O &amp; O SafeErase also allows you to clean traces of our activity on the Internet by deleting data from the browsing history, cookies and any temporary files collected on your computer while browsing the web. All the most popular Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Internet Explorer browsers are supported.
 
 Attention!
 
 The test version application allows for use for 30 days. During this time, the functions that delete the remains of previously deleted files and the "deletion" of entire disks are not available.
