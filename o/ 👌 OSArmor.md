The program deals with monitoring and blocking suspicious processes on a computer with the Windows operating system. This allows you to prevent infections caused by malware, ransomware and other unwanted files. The full list of processes that OSArmor is able to dispose of is located on the official website of the manufacturer.
 
 OSArmor is a supplement to traditional antivirus software, because it can detect dangerous processes that other applications dealing with the security of our PC can not cope with. It is worth adding that OSArmor saves all activities to text files on a regular basis in one directory, which can be accessed with one click in the program menu.
 
 Once launched, OSAarmor is virtually ready for operation. It does not require any interference on the part of the user, therefore it will also be successfully used by less experienced computer owners. However, the tool includes configuration options. From the list, we can choose which processes should be blocked while the application is running.
