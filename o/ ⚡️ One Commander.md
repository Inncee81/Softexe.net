> One Commander is an advanced file manager that allows you to view data in two separate panels and columns. One Commander user interface, referred to by the authors as modern, in fact it is - minimalist and transparent. Just a few minutes of working with the program, to notice that the creators designed it so that the user had quick access to the files. They presented the layout of folders and files in the form of a tree, which turns out to be the ideal solution in this case. One Commander contains a very large number of keyboard shortcuts, which are described in detail on the official website of the producer. In the case of regular use of the tool, it is worth knowing them to reduce the time needed to perform subsequent operations (eg copying, moving, renaming and deleting files). The built-in search engine also makes it easy to locate documents, photos, graphics or any other data. Interestingly, the beta version of the One Commander program was funded by users through a fundraiser carried out on the Kickstarter site. The creators needed 7,500, and they managed to obtain nearly 12 thousand dollars.
