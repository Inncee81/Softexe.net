The program allows you to recover the username and password that we provided when logging in to any website, social service or discussion forum, as long as the user decided to save them during authentication. It can decrypt and read login data from the Triple-DES algorithm encrypted file (wand.dat), which is used by the Opera browser to store this type of information.
 
 The tool can restore all the passwords provided by the user when logging in to the Web using the Opera browser in almost every version (including the Opera Next edition). The recovered information can be saved to the disk in the form of a text file, HTML, CSV or XML.
 
 Attention!
 
 Due to the functionality offered by the tool, it can be detected by antivirus software as potentially harmful and threatening our security, but it is in fact completely safe.
 The program installation wizard offers you the option of installing additional components, but you can omit this operation by clicking on the 'Decline' option.
