This program provides access to hundreds, if not thousands, of materials placed on the network, which we can record (image or audio or the audio track itself), and then upload them to Google Drive or OneDrive and download at any time. onlineTV has been equipped with a search engine that allows you to quickly find TV stations, broadcast stations and more.
 
 onlineTV can boast a modern, transparent interface. In the main window we have 12 icons, thanks to which with a single click we will move to the chosen department to select the material we are interested in.
 
 Individual television stations, radios, webcams and magazines, most of which we use using onlineTV, we can add to bookmarks, which will allow us to get to them quickly after launching the application.
