> OpenTTD is a free reincarnation of the iconic classic Transport Tycoon Deluxe - an economic strategy in which for many years we had to take care of the continuous development and profitability of the transport company we set up. OpenTTD preserves all prototype features, offering many improvements, such as multiplayer mode or support for over a dozen languages ​​and currencies. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that from version 1.0.0 to play we no longer need any files from the original, as was even the case in version 0.7.5.
