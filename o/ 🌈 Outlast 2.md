The player takes on Blake Langermann, the cameraman. He and his wife are investigating, which no one else would lead. The couple follow the directions, the series of which began the strange murder of an unknown pregnant woman. 
 
 
 The investigation led journalists to the Arizona desert, where desperation, blind faith and the promise of paradise are pushing people towards depravity and corruption. 
 
 
 The game is bloody, brutal, dark and we do not recommend it to people with weak nerves or children.
