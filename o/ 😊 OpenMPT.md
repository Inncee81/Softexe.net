The author of the OpenMPT program is Olivier Lapicque, who used his previous work, ModPlug Tracker, to create the described tool. As we are dealing with a product made available free of charge, its creator allows you to import modules in a variety of formats, as well as provides advanced features, such as the ability to use VST and ASIO outputs.
 
 OpenMPT offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface. It is based on elements used in the Windows operating system, so even less experienced users will find the necessary options here, allowing for quick preparation of any song.  
 
 In addition to the ability to edit your own format, OpenMPT also allows the Impulse Tracker, FastTracker, Scream Tracker and ProTracker file modules. Detailed information is available on the manufacturer's official website.
