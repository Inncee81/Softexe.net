The tool allows you to access various information about individual computers. O &amp; O Syspectr generates a hardware report (brand and motherboard model, installed RAM memory, processor, graphics card, etc.), software (list of all installed applications), Windows updates, operating system protection (checks, among other things, whether software is available antivirus, and whether the firewall has been enabled), and also monitor the consumption of the hard disk.
 
 O &amp; O Syspectr uses the web interface, thanks to which we can supervise the work of various equipment (it is necessary to install the described application on them) on any computer or also using portable devices. However, you do not need to manually monitor events, because after performing certain actions on a given PC, the tool will automatically provide us with the necessary information via e-mail.
 
 Attention!
 
  O &amp; O Syspectr requires the creation of a free user account.
