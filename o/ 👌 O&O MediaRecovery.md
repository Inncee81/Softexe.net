> O &amp; O MediaRecovery is a tool designed to recover lost multimedia files (such as movies, photos, music files) from any data media (hard drives, external data magazines, pendrives, etc.). With its help it is possible to restore accidentally deleted files or recover valuable photos lost as a result of formatting the hard disk.

The program's support comes down to following the wizard's next steps, during which we choose the medium from which we want to recover the data, and then we become familiar with the results of the program's work. In the next step, we can select the files to be recovered and indicate the storage medium (which should be different from the one from which we are trying to restore data).
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days and can not recover lost files.
