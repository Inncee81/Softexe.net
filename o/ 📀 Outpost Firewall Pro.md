An interesting feature is the ability to set the computer in "stealth" mode (computer invisible to hackers ...). Outpost offers most of the possibilities typical for this type of programs, its big advantage is relatively simple service, and thanks to the Polish version, it is one of the most friendly "firewalls".Attention!
  The trial version allows you to use the functionally unlimited edition for a period of 30 days.
