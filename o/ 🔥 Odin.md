Odin is available for free and allows you to even update the Android operating system (you can also install a custom version of the software), but not only. Thanks to Odin, we will be able to upload new ROM software, we will be flashing the device, modification of the operating system kernel, and we will enrich the smartphone or tablet with various fan overlays that increase the capabilities of the mobile device.
 
 It is worth remembering that Odin needs to activate the "USB debugging" option in the settings of the smartphone or tablet that we previously connected to the computer via the USB connector.
