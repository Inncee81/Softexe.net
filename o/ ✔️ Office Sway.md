The Sway application is a tool included in the Office suite. It is used to create spectacular multimedia presentations. Unlike PowerPoint, it focuses only on the most important tools that will allow us to easily create a presentation. The interface has been prepared in such a way that it can be operated also from the level of browsers for smartphones and tablets.

To use the application it is necessary to have an account in Microsoft services. After logging in, we gain access to previously created presentations, and newly created ones are saved in the cloud. Projects launched on a different device can be edited and presented from the level of the mobile version.
 The number of available tools is large, and to a large extent based on the addition of content from various sources. During the creation, we are always accompanied by a preview of the effect of our work. In addition, from the level of the program, we can download tutorials that will show us the operation of the application and individual options.
 Supporting, creating and editing presentations, all these operations can be done in a convenient way both on the tablet screen and with the mouse and keyboard. It is simple operation and easy navigation and sharing that are the biggest advantage of Swey, and also an element that distinguishes it from the background of extensive PowerPoint. The program is available for free in the application store for Windows 10.
