The tool is characterized by a modern, user-friendly interface. Odio enables not only manual search of the station, but also selection of stations available in a specific country or language version; we can also filter broadcasts by tags. Importantly, the most interesting stations will be easily added to your library, so you will not have to search them every time you launch the application.
 
 Odio is hard to call a full-fledged multimedia player, because the program contains only the function of starting and stopping the program and adjusting the volume level. Despite everything, it is worth using it, because there is no shortage of Polish stations in the radio station base (eg Radio ZÅ‚ote Przeboje, RMF FM and muzo.fm).
