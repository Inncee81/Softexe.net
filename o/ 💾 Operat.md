It enables the preparation of typical letters, forms and geodetic surveys, among which the most important is the reporting of geodetic works, cover letter, report, letters related to the presentation of borders (notices, address labels, border protocols), maps for various types of maps, list of land changes and many other. All documents created with the use of the program are saved in the database, which allows later retrieval of archived information in accordance with the set criteria.
 
 The program has been equipped with a schedule module that supports the organization of the geodetic company's work. The application can inform about upcoming dates of meetings related to the presentation of boundaries or deadlines. There were also tools for creating contracts, issuing invoices or documenting advances.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
