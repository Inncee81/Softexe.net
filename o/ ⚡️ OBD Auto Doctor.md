The program makes it possible to monitor basic parameters of the main components of the car, as well as, if any, error code reading - broken down into permanent and occasional codes. Thanks to it, in an easy and convenient way, we will diagnose the car when the "check engine" light comes on, we detect what causes the error and save money, which we would have to spend on computer diagnostics at the car mechanic.
 
 OBD Auto Doctor gives access to data recorded by various types of sensors and tools mounted in the car, which appropriate analysis may indicate a failure responsible for eg large combustion, etc.
 
 OBD Auto Doctor is available in the Polish language version for Windows, Linux and Mac OS platforms.
 
 Attention!
 
 To establish a connection between the computer and the car, a special ODB-II interface is required, which should be connected to the diagnostic connector in the car.
