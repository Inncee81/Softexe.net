Opera 58 is a completely new version of a convenient and multifunctional browser from the Norwegian developers, with all the necessary features for a convenient, productive and safe work on the Internet.

Now it is possible to open web versions of popular messengers and communicate with people close to you, without looking up from viewing the main content: VK Messenger, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp are activated automatically, and Telegram require preliminary settings in the sidebar. The developers have provided two ways to use chats - in the form of an external tab or pin next to the current tab. Conveniently, when using several instant messengers, you can easily switch between them using the hot key CTRL + SHIFT + m (for Windows).

Other innovations worth noting various improvements to the user interface. Now this web browser is available in two colors - light and dark. In addition, an interesting set of background images has been prepared that perfectly complement the browser's appearance, making it more individual and unique (the background and color theme can be controlled in the Customize Express Panel panel or in the general browser settings).

As for the page layout, it is now updated with a new high-quality graphic design that is compatible with all platforms. Tabs have become more elegant and concise, which facilitates their placement when opened, and added animation effects to the updated sidebar, making it more subtle. Badges have become more sophisticated and elegant, changing their color if they are active.

In addition to the free VPN implemented in earlier versions, the new Opera has given particular attention to blocking ads. Now the browser automatically reloads the page when you enable or disable ad-blocking for this page, which is very convenient if you want to quickly switch between blocking modes.&nbsp;

And of course, browser developers paid a lot of attention to improving performance and security.

In general, the new Opera has become even more convenient, stylish and fast, allowing you to surf and communicate comfortably and safely on the World Wide Web.
