> Opanda IExif - is a simple but at the same time one of the best programs for analyzing the content of photo metadata, that is, reading Exif data. This information is assigned to each photograph by the camera, in which you can find such items as the exact time of the performance, camera parameters and the thematic programs used. In the case of advanced digital cameras or SLRs, the data can even include details such as the distance that was measured by the lens to the focus point.

The program is very easy to use and is a typical information application. After loading the image that you want to analyze (you can simply drag it to the workspace), all information from the Exifa will be loaded on the screen, which will be displayed in tabular form. They have been grouped according to the topic they concern, making it easier to navigate the entire list.
 
 For greater convenience, the user has several views, including a generic one, in which only the most important information is displayed, full, in which we can find the entire metadata content and two additional ones, of which the GPS view seems more useful, where location data can be compiled in which the photo was taken (if the camera assigned such data during its execution).
