Windows 10 contains many unnecessary functions that are enabled by default after installing this operating system, as well as sends to Microsoft information about the user's geographical location. O &amp; O ShutUp10 allows you to disable these add-ons, disable the microphone and the camera, as well as prevent the system from obtaining data about us to display personalized ads.
 
 O &amp; O ShutUp10 also eliminates the problem related to automatic updates (Windows Update) of the Windows 10 operating system, which are sent to other computers (our server is used) - in this way, new "windows" slow down the operation of individual computers and the Internet. 
 
 The tool offers a clear and transparent interface. The list of options available in the O &amp; O ShutUp10 program is divided into the following categories: protection, privacy, location, user behavior, Windows Update and others. By clicking on a given function, we will display detailed information about its operation. We turn it on or off with just one mouse shift.
