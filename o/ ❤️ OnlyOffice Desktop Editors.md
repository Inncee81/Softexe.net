OnlyOffice Desktop Editors are part of a very wide suite of office applications by Ascensio, which does not require an Internet connection to work. It is free and there are no restrictions on the recording or formats. OnlyOffice Desktop Editors does not have a group work function such as collaborating on a document of many people at once. The program provides the ability to create and edit text documents (DOCX, ODT, RTF, TXT), spreadsheets (XLSX, ODS, CSV) and presentations (PPTX). Everything is in one program, it has not been broken down into individual modules.

All standard formatting elements are available. The sheet is equipped with the same functions as competitive solutions. It is also possible to open and create presentations in pptx format, and although the number of transitions between slides is not as impressive as in the Office, for the needs of most presentations should be enough.
 
 Desktop Editors is only a part of Ascensio's services - from a simple office in the cloud to document management, mail, CRM, project management, calendar. From the program, you can create an account and use the 30-day trial period.
