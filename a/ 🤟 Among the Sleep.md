The abundant imagination of the child allows you to look at the world in a different way than in traditional horror movies. The bear tells you that something is not right, but you still do not know what you need to find a child's mother. The toy is a guide and the only ally in the game. A two-year-old barely walks and in many situations he moves better, crawling, but hugging a teddy bear to light the surroundings, he can only stand up.
 The search leads the hero through surrealistic places, from which one can get out only by finding the right memories.
