The extension allows you to mute sounds on demand or automatically. In the case of the machine, you can add selected sites to the whitelist of admitted sites or enter pages into the blacklist - in this case, the sounds will never be played on these pages. Manual silencing allows you to silence all cards, only the current card or all cards except the current one.
 
 The extension nestles next to the address bar in Chromium. By clicking on the icon you can expand the menu. In addition, the extension can be operated with the help of keyboard shortcuts.
