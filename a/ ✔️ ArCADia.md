ArCADia allows you to draw 2D and 3D documentation, but allows you to save projects in DWG format from 2.5 to 2013, DWF, DWT DXF, DGN and has many tools identical to those in AutoCAD. Work on layers and the command line looks very similar. In addition, ArCADia allows full personalization of settings, commands, toolbars, shortcuts and aliases. Tools give you the ability to import lines, hatches and dimensioning styles.
 
 When creating projects, you can load raster substrates in BMP, JPG, TIF and PNG formats, apply descriptions using TrueType or SHX fonts, linear and angular dimensioning with style records. You can import solids in the ACIS format, but without the ability to create and modify, you can also display Civil 3D and ADT objects. In addition, CAD allows you to load applications written in LISP and SDS. In 3D documents, you can work with textures, light and render creation.
 
 The program allows you to export the documentation in PDF format, as well as the designed models as STL. 
 
 
 The test version of ArCADia works for 28 days.
