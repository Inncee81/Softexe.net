The application allows you to conduct text conversations (PC to PC Chat), video conferencing, audio talks, transferring images to your friends using the drag-and-drop method and much more. The contact list is available in our native messengers in the main application window, where you can see the current status of users. In addition, the communicator is integrated with the American AOL service providing functions such as listening to the radio or watching Internet TV.
 
 The program, apart from supporting its internal network, also allows you to communicate with ICQ users, Yahoo! Messenger and Windows Live Messenger.
