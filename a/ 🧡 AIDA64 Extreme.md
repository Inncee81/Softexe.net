The main task of the program is to provide the largest portion of detailed information about the equipment installed in our computer. It allows you to display data about the processor, motherboard and chipset, memory, hard drives, graphics card and many other devices, as well as software installed on the computer and security level. The tool also supports most types of sensors used by equipment manufacturers, enabling monitoring of parameters such as operating temperature, fan speed or power consumption. All of this information can be displayed, for example, via a gadget on the desktop. AIDA64 Extreme, like most of this type of tools, gives you the opportunity to generate a report containing information about your components and save it, among others in HTML format.
 
 However, the functionality of the new version of this popular tool does not end on the mentioned functionality. AIDA64 Extreme as the name suggests, the program is dedicated to 64-bit system architectures, but also works with 32-bit. In addition to the mechanisms of providing a lot of information about hardware and software, the tool includes a number of useful benchmarks. They allow performing processor tests (using up to 32 cores), RAM, cache, bandwidth test, as well as testing the transfer rate of various types of media - hard drives, SSDs, optical drives, memory cards, etc.
 
 Thanks to the intuitive and Polish-language interface, despite the huge number of program options, its operation is very simple.
 
 Attention!
 The trial version allows you to use the program for a period of 30 days.
