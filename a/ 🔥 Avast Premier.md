The software has been equipped with the best solutions and technologies known from such products as Avast Antivirus and Avast Internet Security. Its foundation is an antivirus and antispyware engine operating in the cloud model, which has constant online access to current virus signature databases, a firewall and an anti-spam filter. Avast Premier also offers a file reputation system, a module that checks the status of updates of the most popular programs, as well as a sandbox component, giving the ability to run any applications in a virtual environment isolated from the system.
 
 Avast Premier also has a built-in SafeZone function that allows you to create trusted sessions in the system, from which you can safely manage your bank account online. There were also file shredders, a special tool for cleaning the web browser from unnecessary toolbars, blocking user-specified URLs and the AccessAnywhere option, which gives you the ability to control your computer from anywhere in the world.
 
 News and changes in version 2018
 
 The most important novelty that hit the new version of the Avast anti-virus package in the Premier version is Webcam Shield. It serves to block access to the webcam built into the laptop frame. In practice, the mechanism is based on an additional layer of permission control - Avast 2018 can manage the access of applications installed on the disk to the camera and block the software that wants to obtain these privileges.
 
 Another new feature is the improved Wi-Fi Inspector, formerly known as Avast Home Network Security. This tool focuses on the security of the router and devices connected to the home network, checking that their firmware is free of gaps. Avast 2017 also brings an improved password manager that stores all user passwords in a central clipboard, an encrypted key derived from the master password, and can automatically complete all forms used to log in to online accounts. In turn, players will appreciate the completely new Game Mode.
 
 We should also mention the passive debut in this edition. Thanks to it, people who already use another antivirus will be able to use the Avasta features that are interesting without having to uninstall other security software.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
