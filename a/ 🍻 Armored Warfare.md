```sh
Fans of games with tanks in the main role got another, dynamically growing and above all free MMO project to check. Armored Warfare is a great leap for the renowned Obsidian Entertainment studio, previously associated primarily with exquisite RPGs. From production, usually turn-based, it has gone through with impetus to make proposals from the mainstream network for a wide audience.

The title focuses on fights in modern scenes and the use of the latest armored technology in battle. You will shoot an enemy under a nuclear reactor in Spain, try to take an island of great strategic importance, defend oil in the Middle East, or play with a cat and a mouse in a ruined port. Armored Warfare can show off an attractive graphic design, and at the same time you do not need such a very powerful computer to run the game.
 
 
 You can choose vehicles from several main categories, from various types of tanks, of course, through armored fighting vehicles, to powerful self-propelled guns. Each of them will also of course develop and improve. The main mode of play is the clash of 15 tankers, but also missions for those wanting to fight with the computer in cooperation with colleagues on the network (up to 5 people). Together, they will face artificial intelligence in more than 20 diverse locations. It is enough to have an efficient, repaired unit.
 
 
 This second option is a great tutorial before entering the real online war, because it is possible to set here, among others, the level of difficulty. The CryENGINE technology is responsible for the high detail of the surroundings and vehicles, the same one that has been used, for example, in fantastically graphical games from the Crysis series. In addition to tending tanks, players must also take care of their base. This enriches the already interesting game with a strategic element.
 
 
 Minimum system requirements:
 
 Intel Core 2 Duo processor E6750 @ 2.66GHz
 2 GB of RAM
 NVIDIA GeForce 9500 GT graphics card
