Among the key options offered by the ASUS GPU TweakII, first of all you can change the clock speed of the GPU and modify the fan speed. Very important functionality also turns out to be access to information related to the GPU's operating temperature and the degree of use of this system during operation.
 
 ASUS GPU TweakII also allows you to change the mode of the system (eg by activating Gaming Mode or Silent Mode) to adjust the speed of the system to the needs of the recipient. In addition, the application presents a number of other, often useful statistics, e.g. related to your version of drivers. You can save your settings by creating user profiles.
 
 ASUS GPU TweakII also supports other manufacturers' chips, but in this case not all features will be available to users.
