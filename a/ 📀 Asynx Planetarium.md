The tool will certainly be appreciated by astronomy enthusiasts, but - as part of a curiosity - users may also be familiar with it, who are not interested in the cosmos on a daily basis. The interface contains a lot of interesting options, but it is intuitive - it allows you to display animations at any speed, to view the phases of the moon and the stars. We can choose any element of the Solar System that we want to observe, and even enter specific coordinates of the object with which we want to read.
 
 Asynx Planetarium offers a time interval from 1970 to 2030, so we'll see what happened in space in the past, what is happening now, as well as find out what scientists predict in the next years.
