The program allows you to view and catalog photos after import to the library, where the files from it are synchronized with the cloud - also digital negatives (RAW, DNG and others). The library is available on all devices within a single Adobe ID account, and can be easily shared with others. 
 
 
 Possibilities of non-destructive photo editing include basic exposure adjustments and color balance, as well as more advanced ones such as fog removal, detail extraction, advanced geometry correction based on designated parallel lines, staining by range, masking effects, retouching and the like. In terms of available tools, the program is practically no different from the Classic Lightroom . 
 
 
 The program can be tested for 7 days without restrictions. The same photo library and changes will be visible in the Lightroom CC mobile application and interface. Adobe Lightroom CC is also distinguished by frequent updates and always supports the latest models of cameras and lenses.
