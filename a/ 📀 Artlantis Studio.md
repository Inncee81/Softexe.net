> Artlantis Studio is a tool for creating photorealistic 3D visualizations of buildings, interior design, gardens and the like, both static and in the form of animations and interactive panoramas for viewing on VR goggles. The program is primarily recommended to architects who want to create impressive visualizations without having to go into time-consuming tools for modeling and project rendering.

A rich library of shaders (materials along with textures) and management of objects and lights significantly accelerate the process of preparing renders. Artlantis has its own physics system that perfectly simulates such phenomena as ambient occlusion. Performing even the most advanced photopresentation does not require tedious trials and experimenting with program parameter settings. Models can be imported in many formats, including DWF, DWG, DXF, OBJ and 3ds. For many programs, data export plugins for Artlantis were created.
 
 The rendering engine allows you to generate an accurate preview of 3D models in the work window. This makes it easier to predict the appearance of the final image and adjust the lighting. Natural light can be adapted to the selected time of day, artificial and properly arranged in space and match the color.
 
 Limitations of the trial version
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for a period of 30 days.
