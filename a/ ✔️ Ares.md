Shared files are organized in the category database, which can be sorted by several criteria (eg type, category). The program automatically searches for a larger number of sources of a given file while increasing its download speed. It offers features such as multiview in tabs, proxy setting, resuming transfers, setting transfer limits, banning users or choosing interface skins. Ares is a very useful function of the built-in media player, offering previews of materials not yet downloaded completely.
 
 In addition, Ares has a Chat tab in which you can create your own or enter existing rooms.
