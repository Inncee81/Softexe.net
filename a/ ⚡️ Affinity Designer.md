> Affinity Designer is a vector graphics creation program, specially designed for designers. The program is able to some extent to open Photoshop, Illustrator and PDF files for editing.

The tools available in the Affinity Designer do not differ significantly from what we find in other vector graphics programs. The tray has a tool for selecting nodes, classic pen and pencil, gradient fill, transparency settings, tools for entering text and placing text on curves, trimming, arc control tool and guides. The tools are completed with a collection of ready-made shapes on which you can perform Boolean operations.
 
 On the side of raster tools you will find a brush and an eraser, as well as selection tools (including lasso and painting selection), smudging, sharpening, blurring, burning and brightening of colors. An interesting feature is the tool "Pixel Brush", which you can paint in vector shapes, but do not lose the opportunity to further edit the paths. Another interesting tool that we will not find in other programs is a vector brush, which uses curves to apply traces imitating natural painting tools, while leaving the possibility of modification. 
 
 
 Affinity Designer is able to save and read files in many raster and vector formats, including partially Photoshop and Illustrator files. It can work in RGB, CMYK, LAB and grayscale spaces, with color management using a depth of 16 bits per channel. When writing, you can export each layer to a separate file, and the files can be placed as objects in other files - in this case, the changes made to the source materials will be constantly updated in other projects.
 
 
 Affinity Designer is in the testing phase and can cause problems.
