The program can connect to printers available via USB or WiFi, and prepare files for printing on Autodesk Ember, Dremel 3D Idea Builder, Makerbot Replicator 2, Ultimaker 2 and Printrbot printers. After selecting the printer model, you can also select the material, print quality and prepare the imported model. 
 
 
 Print Studio allows you to detect problems with the model and possibly fix them with simple tools. You can regain the balance of the model, cut it or patch the gaps in its surface. The next step is to optimally position the model relative to the platform so that printing it requires as few supports as possible. In addition, you can generate bookends and have a good look at them, and finally export a ready file with instructions for the selected printer and view each layer separately.
