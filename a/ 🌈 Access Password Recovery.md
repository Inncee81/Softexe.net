The program can recover lost or forgotten passwords securing access to these files using three different methods - brute-force, attack using a mask and a dictionary. It perfectly copes with documents created using the Microsoft Access application in versions 2003, XP, 2000 and 97, and also allows you to break the password blocking the editing option.
 
 Access Password Recovery, despite the lack of the Polish language version, will certainly not cause any problems to anyone. The tool is operated using a built-in wizard that guides you through the process of password cracking step-by-step.
