AKVIS Neon is a program thanks to which we will add remarkable lighting effects to photos. Thanks to it, you can make animal fur shine, hair of the model will turn into flames, and night photos will look like fairy-tale landscapes. If we decide on other settings, the contours will take on a dark-comic character.

The main advantage of the program is the ability to quickly modify photos. It does not require any manual drawing of paths or sketching - the only thing a photographer has to do is to choose the effect and adjust the settings: detail visibility, light intensity, blur and darkness. You can also take advantage of the color reversal option. The program also has the option of applying text and your own image to the image, which does not work out well. You can also apply various textures, such as canvas or sketch paper, and color the image with the selected color. You can save your own settings to a collection of finished effects. 
 
 
 Work with the program can take place in two modes - express and advanced. They differ in the availability of some advanced settings. Since generating the preview is quite time-consuming, the program allows you to preview the effect on a part of the image. The size of the window with preview can be specified in the settings. 
 
 
 AKVIS Neon is available as an add-on to Photoshop or an independent program. It can be tested for 10 days. The price of the full version varies between 29 and 55 euros, depending on the type of license and the set of possibilities - the comparison can be found on the manufacturer's website .
