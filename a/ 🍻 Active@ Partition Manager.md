The tool copes well with the recognition of volumes with the following file systems: FAT, NTFS, NTFS + EFS, MacOS HFS +, Linux Ext2 / Ext3 / Ext4, Unix UFS and BtrFS. Active @ Partition Manager supports both older and newer versions of popular "windows", including Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows XP, Windows 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2012 and WinPE.  
 
 Active @ Partition Manager allows you to easily format a logical disk or partition (FAT, exFAT, NTFS), change logical disk size, edit and synchronize FAT boot sectors, exFAT, NTFS, UFS, HFS + and Ext2 / Ext3 / Ext4, and initiate a new one MBR or GPT disk, or repairing a damaged MBR disk (GPT). It also allows you to familiarize yourself with the advanced settings and attributes of partitions, hard disk or logical drive.  
 
 Using Active @ Partition Manager, we also perform operations such as conversion of MBR to GPT or GPT to MBR, withdrawal of changes (creation, deletion, formatting and hard disk initialization), assignment or change of partition attributes (drive letter name), formatting of flash memory as NTFS, create FAT32 partitions larger than 32 GB (up to 1 TB), or even create multiple partitions on a USB flash device.
