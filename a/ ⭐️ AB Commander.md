AB Commander is a two-panel file manager with similar capabilities as the popular Total Commander, which is a remarkable alternative to Windows Explorer. Apart from standard file management functions, the program also includes a graphics browser, options for data sharing and synchronization, slide show presentation and a built-in text editor.

The application gives the user the possibility of efficient and comfortable work with the contents of two folders at the same time, while offering a rich set of tools for navigation and file management. The available quick access features, such as the drive bar, lists with favorite locations and those opened some time ago, customizable toolbars and keyboard shortcuts, considerably facilitate moving between different disk locations and save valuable user time.
 
 More demanding receipts will certainly appreciate other program functions, such as the built-in command line, filtering, comparing and synchronizing directories, support for regular expressions, as well as support for virtual and compressed folders.
