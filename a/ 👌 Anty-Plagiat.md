The program is very easy to use and gives the possibility to conveniently check any type of text or the sentences contained in it have been copied by the author. Just paste a piece of text in the main application window or load a text file, define the search engine for analysis, and then click 'Start' to initiate the plagiarism detection operation.
 
 Anti-Plagiarism is a fast-acting tool which, as a result of its activity, will display information on the percentage of the text plagiarized, highlight fragments copied in red and, moreover, give links to locations on the Web where texts with similar content have been published. The application is able to search the entire Internet - including sites with downloads, studies or diploma thesis.
 
 As the creator assures, the tool is completely safe. Materials checked with its use are in no way made available to third parties.
 
 Attention!
 The test version allows you to check up to about 100 lines.
