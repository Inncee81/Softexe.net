Sitting at the controls of a small but well-armed submarine, we get the task of finding an antidote for a virus that has been in the human race for a long time. Apparently the medicine is inside a cruel pounding, which, apart from being hidden, does not show any willingness to cooperate.
 
 Exploring the endless underwater labyrinths, we also focus on the additional mission of identifying new life forms. A special scanner helps us in this, which will scan the encountered life forms and provide relevant information about them. However, it should be skillfully used, because having it running we will not be able to repulse violent and often unexpected attacks of hostile sea creatures.
 
 Along with the duration of the game, we gain special energy points, thanks to which we can expand, refine and upgrade our ship. This helps in the fight against opponents and allows you to move slightly faster underwater territories.
 
 The game is full of puzzles and all kinds of tasks to do, which causes that sometimes we can turn well in the tangle of underwater corridors, but this only makes production more attractive. It should be remembered that at selected moments, we can leave the cockpit and personally explore the ocean's depths. The pace of the game is deliberately not too high to better reflect the climate prevailing for several kilometers under water, where at any moment something amazing or something that the eye of a person has never seen before can meet us ...
 
 Aquarius has a nice audiovisual setting, and all the struggles in the game are very pleasant. Despite the general ease of running the game, the title will require a lot of patience and self-denial in pursuing the goal.
