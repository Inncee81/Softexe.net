The program is ideal when working on a variety of projects, whether in the company, at school or at home. Instead of manually comparing the introduced modifications in source files, agreements or websites, we can launch Araxis Merge to quickly find differences between various documents, photos or any other files saved in almost every format.
 
 Araxis Merge does not require any special knowledge on the part of the user. All you need to do is run the selected files from the main program menu. As in other programs of this type, the user can freely define the rules for comparing data, for example, to ignore blank spaces or the size of letters.
 
 Interestingly, Araxis Merge also offers the function of generating reports to HTML, XML and UNIX formats, which we can then provide to our colleagues or print. 
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days. To run the trial version a key is required, which can be obtained on the manufacturer's page .
