The described application allows you to assign keys and mouse buttons to a selected controller (eg Xbox One), from which we will make use of older productions as well as various programs. Thanks to antimicro, we will be able to control every tool installed on the computer using the gamepad.
 
 antimicro offers the function of saving settings to a file, which means that we can load numerous configurations if necessary. This is not the end, because from the level of the main window, we can easily and quickly switch between the profiles created.
