Creating new icons can be used primarily from the menu on the left, where you can discover new packages, divided into categories. When you choose one of them, you can choose a specific graphic in the main preview. Then you can add additional graphics to it at one of the corners: all settings in this range are controlled on the right panel.
 
 When choosing next graphics for the project, you should add them to the collection (they will appear on the bottom bar in the program) so that you can export them for later use in the applications you create. The program is one of the more intuitive applications of this kind, and more importantly, guaranteeing great results also in the hands of novice users.
