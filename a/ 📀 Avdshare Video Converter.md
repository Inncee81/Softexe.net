With the support of Avdshare Video Converter, even less experienced customers will cope. All you need to do is add the selected files to the main program window by clicking the "add file" button and specifying the recording path of your videos. Then you have to use the "profile" function, where you define the output format, and then click the play icon located in the bottom right corner of the screen. After the conversion, Avdshare Video Converter will immediately open the folder window containing the file in the new format.
 
 Among the supported file formats, we find not only the most popular, but also less frequently used ones. The full list is very extensive, which is why we will find it only on the official website of the Avdshare Video Converter.
 
 Avdshare Video Converter is not only a converter, because the tool performs also other functions. We can even make use of the built-in, uncomplicated video editor to remove unnecessary parts, rotate video by 90 or 180 degrees, divide a large file into several smaller ones and add or remove subtitles. There is also the option to customize video settings, including resolution, frame rate and volume.
