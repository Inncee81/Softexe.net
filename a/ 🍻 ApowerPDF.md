Display modes
 
 You can prepare new PDF documents from empty files, as well as read the materials sent to you, displaying a single page or two pages side by side with the scroll function or without such a possibility to present the contents of a given page on the entire screen.
 
 Quick modification in many ways
 
 Do you want to split one larger document into smaller PDFs? Nothing easier. You are reviewing the text and are going to add comments to the fragments you just read? Add comments, enter underlines, insert notes, and even drawing marks. You can also secure your work with a watermark.
 
 Built-in PDF converter
 
 ApowerPDF includes the ability to change file formats. Having a document saved as a PDF, we can convert it to Word, Excel, HTML, image, PPT and many, many others. You do not need to install additional tools to perform all the necessary operations on your projects.
