Creating games in AGS does not require programming skills, however, more advanced projects require knowledge of the scripting language. The graphics quality can be selected depending on the needs in the resolution range from 320x200 to 800x600 pixels and in the range of colors from 8 - bit to 32 - bit.
 
 Games can be run both in full-screen mode and in the window. The game can be enriched with soundtracks from OGG, MP3, WAV, MOD, XM and MIDI files. Production can be compiled into a standalone EXE file.
