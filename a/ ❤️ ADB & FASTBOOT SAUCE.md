ADB &amp; FASTBOOT SAUCE is a small program that allows you to connect to the Android console on a mobile device. The application also uses the Fastboot protocol, allowing you to modify system components.

A special feature of this application is the method of its operation. Similarly to other proposals of this type, it offers a text interface, but instead of manually entering the appropriate commands, it is enough to refer to their digital shortcuts displayed in the form of a text menu. For example, to display the Fastboot option menu, simply enter the number 1 and confirm the operation with the Enter key.
 
 It is worth noting that among the program options we will also find the data recovery option thanks to TWRP , but at the moment it remains experimental.
 
 The application is devoted to a separate thread on XDA Developers, which is at the same time the main distribution channel of the application, so it is worth reaching for it in case of additional problems.
