Before we open the main program window, we will have to choose the type of mosaic we intend to prepare. In addition to traditional tiles in a square or rectangle, AndreaMosaic allows you to create a mosaic using a freeze frame from the selected movie. It should be noted that the only supported format is JPG.
 
 AndreaMosaic offers numerous customization options, that's why you can change the size and resolution of our mosaic, as well as modify the size of individual tiles. We can also rotate the image by 90 or 180 degrees, create a mirror image and more.
 
 It is worth noting that the official site of the producer AndreaMosaic will download not only the installer, but also a package of samples, through which we will check the capabilities of the described program.
