The program offers several preview options - music, guitar tablature or simplified. The user can add sounds, edit their length as well as intensity. We can choose from dozens of instruments from the MIDI palette, change the tempo and the beat of the song. Other functions include enlarging and adding a description and notes. Aria Maestosa is characterized by a simple, minimalistic interface that allows you to quickly find out about the possibilities of the program. Using the preferences panel, we can, among others, set the default preview of the song.
 
 Files are saved in the default format for the program; they can also be exported to MIDI or audio.
