The program will certainly satisfy most beginners, expecting solutions of this type of maximum simplicity of use and configuration. Its capabilities have been reduced to a minimum to what the application is also fast and consumes small amounts of system resources.
 
 In addition to the built-in data search engine with the option of filtering results, Vuze Leap does not offer any additional functions. After finding the desired file, the user can start downloading the file, observe the progress of downloading individual files on the list, and restore selected files using external software.
 
 As with the available functions, the number of configuration options offered has also been limited to the minimum necessary. The user has the option of defining the program as the default torrent client and whether it should be run along with the system, the location where the downloaded data will be saved, as well as limiting incoming and outgoing transfers.
