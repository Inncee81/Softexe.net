AutoplayStopper is an extension for the Chrome browser that blocks the automatic playback of ads and video content in Flash and HTML5. Previously it was developed as FlashStopper for Firefox.

AutoplayStopper works on the principle of "white lists". You can allow specific pages to automatically play movies or stop only the first video in a longer session (for example, from the list on YouTube or Dailymotion). You can also disable the detection of Flash content on pages and enforce the use of the HTML5 player on them. 
 
 
 Switching between pause and allowing it requires only one click. The playback button and context menu will appear on the materials that the extension has responded to.
 
 The extension should work properly on all pages with HTML5 players and on: YouTube, Facebook, Dailymotion, Msn, Bing, Yahoo! (without Flash detection), Aol, Huffington Post, BBC News, NBA.com, NFL.com and many more.
