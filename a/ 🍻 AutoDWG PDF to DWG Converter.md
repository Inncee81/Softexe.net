The tool is therefore aimed at users who have important projects in PDF format that they would like to transfer to AutoCAD (versions from 2019 to R14 are supported). AutoDWG PDF to DWG Converter is available in several variants. If we decide to buy a Pro or Server edition, we'll be able to convert files in batch mode. This option is inactive in the standard version of the described application.
 
 Before starting the conversion operation, indicate the file, and then specify the recording path, while defining whether AutoDWG PDF to DWG Converter is to convert the entire PDF document or only selected pages. You must also specify the format of the output file and the version of AutoCAD with which it will work.
 
 AutoDWG PDF to DWG Converter, thanks to the intelligent object recognition function, offers increased conversion quality. In addition, keep in mind that the tool does not make any changes to the files, which is why the PDF source document will contain exactly the same as a DWG or DXF file created using AutoDWG PDF to DWG Converter.
