Actiona is based on creating action lists (scripts) using the drag-and-drop technique, and also has an intuitive interface. We can define simple and advanced commands related to any programs, the operation of popular "windows" and a specific device, selected files, system processes and many, many more.
 
 Although initially it may seem that Actiona is directed only to advanced users, it does not really require knowledge of any programming language. However, more experienced recipients can use JavaScript (EcmaScript) to extend the functions of the described tool.
 
 Actiona also allows you to create shortcuts to selected scripts, which can be useful when you have to do the same task repeatedly.
