The tool was created to track the actions of employees in small companies, but successfully used wherever it is necessary to monitor the actions of computer users (eg school computer labs, libraries, etc.). It offers extensive functionality that allows comprehensive monitoring of operations performed on a computer, and also generates activity reports based on them. Activity Monitor gives the ability to preview the desktop image from a remote computer or to record information about visited websites and launched applications.
 
 In addition, the program can store a full communication history for each user, including sent / received e-mails, IM conversations (Skype, Yahoo Messenger, AIM (Instant Messenger), ICQ, IRC, MSN Messenger, Windows Live Messenger), and even news published on internet forums, blogs, social networking sites and others. There was also a function of creating screenshots, capturing characters typed on the keyboard, monitoring external data carriers and remotely performing various file operations.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 15 days and monitor only one workstation.
