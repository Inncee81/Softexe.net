To start the operation of changing the audio file format, it is enough to right click in Windows Explorer on the selected file - then the program will start to convert to one of the selected formats, such as MP3, M4A, AAC, OGG, WMA, FLAC, AU, WAV, AIFF, MP2, AC3, AU, APE, MPC, MOD, VOC, CAF, RAW, PCM, GSM, VOX, WV.
 
 AUDIOzilla Audio Converter allows you to choose whether we want to convert the whole audio file or its fragment, specify the bitrate, audio channels, sample size and decide whether we intend to store or delete information about the tags of the sound file. It is also possible to extract the audio track from a video file in the MP4, WMV, ASF or M4V format and directly convert the Audio CD (CDA) with the option to save information about the album.
