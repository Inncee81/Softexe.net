ADeko is an interior design program that allows you to quickly prepare the visualization of the kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, office or any other space. In many cases, the program can automatically generate an alternative layout of furniture and equipment, which is particularly useful when creating kitchen furniture design proposals. Generated designs can be modified by changing dimensions, finish colors, handles and the like.

We have here a huge library of ready-made furniture, decorative materials and accessories, as well as the ability to create your own textures. When designing the kitchen, you can quickly change the finishing elements of the entire set at the same time, as well as arrange floor tiles, tiles and automatically arrange accessories.
 
 When drawing walls of rooms, the program automatically measures angles, and you can also insert partitions and columns. Furniture designers can also create their own model libraries and work with non-standard lumps, such as shelves for bevels or built-in cavities without right angles. 
 
 
 ADeko lets you work in a view from one side or from a perspective view. The presentation is so realistic that in many cases you do not need to render visualizations. You can use the built-in program engine for rendering, as well as VRay and Maya programs. ADeko saves files in DWG format.
 
 The finished project can be presented together with the valuation and technical drawings, ready to be printed. For the factories you can develop cutting plans with information about additional places to be wrapped and labels on individual elements. 
 
 
 You can download the ADeko program, but it requires a license number to run. The manufacturer does not provide a test license.
