The program was initially available only for the Linux system, but its fast growing popularity meant that it was also decided to provide versions for Windows and Mac OS. The tool supports AVI, MPEG, MP4 and ASF files, often being used to convert movies to formats compatible with most stationary DVD players. In addition, it offers quite a number of functions and effects, which can additionally be extended to external components.
 
 With the help of Avidemux, apart from the conversion itself, we can also perform simple operations on cages (pasting, cutting, replacing) and apply filters to them. Among the latter, there are items that allow you to crop the image, change its resolution, rotate the angle, apply subtitles, sharpen the image and much, much more. One of the interesting options is a built-in calculator, thanks to which we can determine what parameters should be declared so that the converted file will fit on a CD, DVD, etc. In turn, users who process a significant amount of files will be pleased that Avidemux has a project mechanism and scripts support, which allow such a process to be automated.
 
 Avidemux, despite its enormous possibilities, has a very friendly and easy to use interface that should not cause any problems even for novice users.
