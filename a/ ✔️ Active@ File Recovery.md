The program copes quite well with the recovery of data lost just before its installation, as well as those deleted some time ago. For both of these cases, the developers have prepared separate search methods for missing files - Quick Scan and Super Scan, respectively. However, this is not all, in cases when the mentioned methods fail, there is also the Last Chance option, which finds deleted files according to their signatures.
 
 Active @ File Recovery supports HDD, IDE, SATA, eSATA, SCSI, SSD, RAID arrays, USB portable media and memory cards that work on FAT, exFAT, NTFS, ReFS, Apple HFS +, Unix UFS file systems as well as Ext2, Ext3, Ext4, BtrFS, XFS and JFS.
