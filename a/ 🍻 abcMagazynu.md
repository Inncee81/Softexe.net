Attention! From January 1, 2018, the obligation to keep electronic VAT records and to submit them as a Uniform Control File (JPK) is introduced. The abcMagazyn program is prepared for these changes and allows you to generate JPK-MAG files.
 
 The application offers the ability to run any number of warehouses, supports PZ, WZ, RW, PW, PL, MM and other documents, and also allows you to run an unlimited index of products and services. abcMagazynu is equipped with functions for handling documents and currency magazines. It automatically downloads exchange rates, NBP tables or documents in English.
 
 abcMagazynu allows you to automatically create local backups of all data collected in the program, which protects the entrepreneur from the loss of relevant information and documents.
