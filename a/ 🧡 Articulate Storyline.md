Although, after launching the program, it may seem that Articulate Storyline was created for experienced recipients, creators have designed it so that it is also accessible to beginners. To use the tool, you do not need to have any programming skills - you can start working immediately.
 
 Articulate Storyline does not require creating a multimedia presentation or e-learning course from scratch, because it contains numerous templates that you can use to prepare the initial version of your project. We will also find here nearly 50,000 different elements to use.
 
 The program is characterized by a modern and transparent interface. A very interesting option in Articulate Storyline is the ability to place the most used panels (just move them with the mouse) anywhere, so we have quick access to the most important options.
 
 It is worth noting that Articulate Storyline offers the function of importing materials from such programs as Articulate Replay and Articulate Quizmaker as well as Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and various text files. 
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
