The program, despite the fact that it has a functionality limited to the commercial edition, is very well suited to home applications when archiving data collected on hard disks. With its help, it is possible to conveniently create a full backup of all files from the partitions indicated by the user, and, if necessary, restore them. The tool allows you to create so-called data backups on local disks and at designated network locations, and burn them to CD / DVD.
 
 Other, no less useful functions Active @ Disk Image Lite is a built-in image explorer that allows you to conveniently browse the contents of the indicated backup, as well as an integrated virtual emulator in which we can mount previously created backups and use them in Windows as standard disks. There were also options to split the backup into smaller files (of a fixed size), to protect the copy with a password, and to compress to reduce the output file with the disk image.
