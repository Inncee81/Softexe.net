Apex Legends is battle royale from the first person perspective, but we do not act alone in it. Instead, we must join one of twenty teams (in each of three players) and cooperate with the team members. The clash ends when only one team is left on the battlefield. Apex Legends offers only multiplayer and does not contain a story campaign, but the history of some characters will be known during the network game.
 
 We start our fun by landing on the map, where our first goal is to get the necessary equipment. We must take care of access to the weapon, as well as find armor and other items that will help us survive. However, it will not be easy, because in Apex Legends the area where the competition is taking place is gradually reduced, so that we could more easily find other participants of the game.
 
 Apex Legends has been prepared by Respawn Entertainment. The game takes place in a universe known from the previous work of the said studio, or Titanfall. You play the title Legend, the hero you choose from the many characters available. Each of them has unique types of weapons and abilities. Over time, we can unblock new protagonists as long as we can advance to the next levels of experience.
 
 It is worth noting that the creators of Apex Legends implemented a micropayment system, but for real money you can buy only cosmetic accessories, not items giving us an advantage over other players.
