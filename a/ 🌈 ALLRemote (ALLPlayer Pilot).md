The program primarily allows you to control multimedia players, including, of course, ALLPlayer, Widnows Media Player, KMPlayer, VLC and many others from the application level. The control is possible via the local network, and for a fee also via the Internet.
 
 In addition, the program allows you to transfer files from the Android device (with the application installed) to the computer and save them in the previously specified folder. In the program, you can schedule a temporary shutdown of the computer, turn on the sound at a selected time, disconnect Internet access and similar simple tasks.
 
 There is also an SMS gateway (payable) and a small computer activity monitor.
