> ALLPlayer is the most downloaded, free program for watching movies and listening to music, which, thanks to the built-in codecs, can reproduce virtually any multimedia file format. Thanks to cooperation with the largest Napisy24.pl subtitle service, the program finds and downloads perfectly matched subtitles in every language.

The application stands out for its modern and intuitive interface known more from the use of smartphones or tablets than from the Windows system. Thanks to this, all functions are easily accessible when they are needed. The newest program engine, in addition to improved support for the latest audio and video standards, such as 4K, UltraHD or WebM support, also introduces improvements in the use and quality of the displayed subtitles. By connecting to the leading service with Napisy24.pl subtitles and such databases as Napiprojekt.pl and Opensubtitles.org, ALLPlayer automatically downloads perfectly matched subtitles in the selected language.
 
 ALLPlayer provides support for all known formats and subtitle encoding. The engine also improves their appearance and the ability to adjust (color, background, size and type of font), and the innovative function "Smart Subtitles", can adjust the time of their display to the speed of reading. If there are no subtitles in the database, the program will notify the user by e-mail or text as soon as they become available. The described functions also work when playing .torrent files. For those who do not like to read subtitles and prefer watching movies with a teacher, the developers have provided the function of a speech synthesizer.
 
 The player also allows you to listen to dozens of radio stations (including RMF FM, Radio Zet, TOK FM or AntyRadio). The user also gets access to a free and up-to-date database of several hundred films in the VOD service. Thanks to the special ALLPlayer Pilot app, the program can be controlled from the level of an Android smartphone and transfer files between paired devices.
 
 ALLPlayer is full of other useful functions, without which no major player can live. Among them, we can play CD / DVD movies, multimedia files from .torrent and movies packed with RAR, support for up to 4 monitors or TVs, automatic playback of subsequent parts of divided movies or series, Dolby Surround support, DTS, 3D Audio, SPDIF and others, equalizer functions and audiovisualizations, support for audio-video streams, including YouTube videos, any image rotation, color correction with quality improvement, computer / monitor shutdown after the screening, autoresume - resume watching from the end, and parental function - securing the file with a password .
 
 Attention!
 
 During installation, the wizard offers the user a substitute for the start page in the web browser. However, this operation is not mandatory and can be omitted by deselecting the appropriate option.
