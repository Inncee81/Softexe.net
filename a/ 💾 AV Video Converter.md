After placing the selected video on the list, we specify the parameters of the output file (not only the format, but also the resolution, zoom, aspect ratio and quality), and then we start the conversion. The clear interface of the main AV Video Converter window makes performing these actions intuitive, and the process of changing the file format runs smoothly and smoothly even in batch mode.
 
 It is worth adding that this program also allows you to extract the soundtrack from a movie to a sound file saved in one of the selected formats: AAC, AC3, ALAC, DTS, FLAC, M4A, MP2, MP3, Opus, OGG, Speex, WAV, WavPack, WMA and others.
