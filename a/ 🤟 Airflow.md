Using Airflow is fabulously simple. It's enough to use the drag-and-drop technique to place any movie in the main program window, and then start watching. It is worth noting here that Airflow also supports subtitles in DVD and Blu-Ray movies. Also noteworthy is full 5.1 audio support for both Chromecast and Apple TV. Importantly, during the screening, the tool consumes only a small amount of computer resources.
 
 Airflow also allows you to create playlists, so after completing one episode of the series, we do not have to approach the computer to enable another. Comfort of use is also guaranteed by the function of remembering where we finished watching the movie, so returning to it, we will start the screening in the same place where we stopped it last time.
