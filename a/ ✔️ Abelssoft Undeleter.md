The operation of this program is based on the wizard, so that less experienced computer users will also be able to perform the data restoration operation. First, choose the hard disk partition, then specify the type of files that we want to recover (all or only photos, videos or documents), and then decide whether Abelssoft Undeleter has to conduct a quick or in-depth scan.
 
 After scanning, Abelssoft Undeleter generates a list of files to be recovered. You should select them, then use the "save as" function in the bottom right corner of the screen, while remembering to put the recovered files on a different partition than the one from which you restored them.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
