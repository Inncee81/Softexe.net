The program will, among others, calculate the equivalent resistance in the system, coil inductance, resistor voltage divider or resistor for the LED diode. There are also power and frequency converters, unit and number converter (between decimal, binary, octal and hexadecimal), decoder strip on resistors, which will allow you to calculate their resistance, and even a font generator in the form of bitmaps.
 
 In the application you will also find a knowledge base about electronic components, for example a list of Atmega series microcontrollers and all their technical parameters, as well as data about TDA and 4000 and 7400 series. It is also possible to create new databases in which you can include your own elements.
 Attention!
 After unpacking the archive file, the program does not require installation.
