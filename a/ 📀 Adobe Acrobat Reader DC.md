The application, apart from the possibility of opening PDF materials, also allows for convenient printing and enriching with comments and marking selected fragments by deleting. Adobe Acrobat Reader supports PDF files with forms, allowing them to be filled in comfortably, while also supporting all PDF documents, preserving the original look, font, colors and graphics. It also works well with encrypted materials and signed with a digital signature.
 
 News and changes in the DC version
 
 The DC reader with the possibility of connection to Document Cloud has gained a new interface, including tools for teamwork, ie the ability to comment on documents, add notes, highlight text, and draw lines, shapes and insert stamps in PDF files. Thanks to the Mobile Link service that accompanies the new cloud, it is possible to open recently used documents on other devices without copying and mailing them - they will simply appear in the list of files in the mobile application or DC Router on a different computer.
 
 The addition of digital signatures or initials to sent documents has also been significantly simplified. 
 
 The new version of the program, like mobile applications, also allows you to easily fill out forms and use the hints. Most of the functions associated with file transfer, of course, require connection to Adobe servers and Adobe ID, but you can view the documents without logging in. As previously announced, Reader DC will also use the network services of other manufacturers. The program already has the ability to read files from SharePoint, more types of accounts will appear in subsequent versions of the program.
 
 The basic version of the program allows you to browse files, comment, add certificates and use the "ruler". More advanced features, such as combining documents, optimizing scans, comparing documents, preparing forms, advanced printing or creating indexes, require a subscription to Document Cloud. In Poland, unfortunately, only a higher subscription is available, namely Acrobat Pro DC, costing 18.44 euros per month, if you commit to paying for at least a year. You can also buy access to Acrobat Pro for only one month for 30 euros.
 
 Attention!
 
 The new version is available in the form of an update available for download after clicking the "All versions" button and selecting the "upgrade to 18.011.20055" option.
