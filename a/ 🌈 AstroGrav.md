The program is addressed not only to scientists, because it will be recognized by other people interested in astronomy. They can download various projects provided by AstroGrav developers via the official website, where we will find, among others, various solar systems or planets for observation.
 
 AstroGrav offers the possibility to simulate the development of the solar system over many thousands of years, revealing the universe with the help of interactive preview in full three dimensions. Views are available from anywhere on Earth or in space.
 
 In addition, AstroGrav has constellations and over 100,000 backgrounds with stars (along with extensive information on each star). Also available are comprehensive tabular data with over 30 editing fields for each object. In addition, the tool provides the function of manually creating new bodies or importing them from a large base of comets and asteroids.
