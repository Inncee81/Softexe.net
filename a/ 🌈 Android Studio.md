Android Studio is a fully equipped platform for developing and testing applications for the Android operating system. The developers of this shell (Google) have implemented all the necessary tools for convenient and high-quality design of new applications and refinement of existing ones. The program includes components such as the Android SDK, all versions of the Android OS, an emulator for running applications, elements of testing and debugging programs.

Creating a new project, you will have access to the complete structure of the application with all the files, which allows you to more clearly and thoughtfully organize the development process itself. The display of the changes and additions is very conveniently implemented - visually in real time, transformations occur depending on the specified actions. Importantly, the program allows you to do application development for all versions of the OS Andriod (from 1.0 to 5.0) and for various devices - you can pre-evaluate the appearance of the program, for example, under a tablet or smartphone.

As for writing the application code, everything is well thought out here: there is a convenient code marking that allows you to easily navigate large projects. In addition, individual components can be modified by dragging and dropping to another desired location, which greatly simplifies editing. 

It is worth noting that the platform has a Google Cloud Messaging tool. This feature allows you to set up sending push notifications for applications via cloud services directly to your Android device. 

In general, Android Studio has quite a lot of useful and useful qualities that Android developers will appreciate. Now, before the release of the application, you can really conduct a full test, check the stability of the program in different modes of operation and, if necessary, correct the shortcomings.
