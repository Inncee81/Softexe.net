> AfterShot Pro is a Corela program released at the beginning of 2012 presenting the company's approach to digital photography. The program uses interesting technologies that belong not only to Corel and enables very flexible, non-linear and non-destructive image processing as well as advanced cataloging.

Corel AfterShot Pro can be used for cataloging, retouching, image manipulation and so-called RAW calling (for a list of supported camera models, see the Corel website ). The cataloging possibilities are supported by an extensive search engine that reads the metadata and author's own tags, and the photos can be arranged in albums, sorted by tags, evaluated and compared. However, the most important feature of this program is the ability to un-destructively modify photos and place modifications on layers, thanks to which selected editing steps can be turned off or removed, which gives almost unlimited editing possibilities in a rather non-linear process. It is also possible to edit multiple versions of the photo at the same time and compare the results. 
 
 
 Among the tools you will find all necessary "sliders" for adjusting exposure, white balance and colors, and the Perfectly Clear automatic mode based on the Athentech technology of the same name. In this mode, the lighting of each pixel of the photo is adjusted to preserve the natural color without adding a shadow. The technology can also be used to remove tints and to save faded and underexposed images. Noteworthy are also good quality tools for removing noise, both appearing on RAWs, as well as images saved in JPG format. For removing noise, AfterShot uses the algorithms of the PictureCode company, which we know from the Noise Ninja program . So it is something to play with. 
 
 
 Correction can also be applied to selected parts of the image thanks to layers and masks. There are various selection tools available, which allow you to select the area to be modified and the softness of the edges with considerable precision. In order to be able to retouch the photos, the tools palette has classic "healing" and cloning brushes with the option of changing the source, size and hardness of the edge. There were also opportunities to build galleries that you can place on your website. Noteworthy is also an interesting magnifier, which enlarges the area under the probe and gives an insight into the details of the photo without enlarging the whole view, which makes it easier to navigate. The tool for straightening the image, in addition to the line marking the horizontal "horizon" of the frame, also displays a very helpful grid. 
 
 
 An important advantage of Corel AfterShot Pro is cross-platform. The program is available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, which is not common among Corela products. AfterShot Pro we can have for $ 99, but you can also buy a upgrade version for $ 79. The discount is available to holders of valid licenses for Corel PaintShop Photo Pro X2 or newer and Bibble Pro or Lite 5 , Adobe Lightroom and Apple Aperture .
