It is characterized by a modular structure and cooperation with many popular programming languages ​​and databases - including PHP, MySQL etc. Apache, despite many of its imperfections - eg vulnerability to DoS attacks - is constantly developed and used as an environment where many popular websites and online stores or discussion forums operate. Another very important advantage of Apache are the large configuration and availability options for Windows, Linux and Mac OS.
 
 The latest releases of the server are equipped with a graphical interface that greatly simplifies and speeds up the process of its configuration.Attention!
 The developers of the Apache server provide rich documentation (unfortunately only in the English version), where you can find information on changes in new releases and the installation and configuration of the server along with its individual modules. It is available on the official website of the project .
