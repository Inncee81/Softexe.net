The purpose of the plug-in is to enable basic image processing before editing the photo in Photoshop. Camera Raw allows you to correct perspective distortions resulting from lens construction, chromatic aberrations and vignetting based on built-in lens profiles or in manual mode. In addition, you can pre-trim images from Camera Raw, remove noise, make basic retouching, improve exposure, hue and white balance. At the moment, Adobe Camera Raw offers support for more than 270 camera models, among which we can find devices from such companies as Canon, Nikon, Fuji, Olympus, Samsung etc.
