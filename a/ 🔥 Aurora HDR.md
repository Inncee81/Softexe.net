In Aurora HDR, we're able to improve the color and detail of photos, the ability to apply changes to layers, brushes for painting effects, textures, vignettes and various effects for styling. 
 
 Most important, however, is that the program has been equipped with proprietary tone mapping algorithms, so it will provide completely different effects than the well known Photomatix or HDR Expose. Before merging photos, you can use the matching position and remove "ghosts", or traces left behind moving objects. 
 
 
 
  There is also an Aurora HDR Pro version that allows you to apply an unlimited number of layers to the image and allow you to compose an image of an unlimited number of images with masking the brightness. In addition, we find a module for developing RAWs and the possibility of correcting lens errors, such as chromatic aberrations. Aurora HDR Pro can work independently or as a plug-in for Photoshop and Lightroom. In the price of the program, we will get a license to install the program on five Macs. 
 
 
 In the Pro version of the program there are also several built-in settings, specially prepared for it by Trey Ratcliff , a photographer and a valued teacher. You can also buy a package of Aurora HDR Pro and training materials by Ratcliff for $ 129. 
 
 
 If you do not have a well-prepared series of photos, you can download trial packages from the MacPhun website .
