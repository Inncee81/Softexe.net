The program is also equipped with several dozens of textures and predefined geometric shapes that we can use in the editing process and has interesting filters and special effects. AvancePaint also has tools to change the size of the graphics, convenient cropping and adding frames to photos. In addition, thanks to the VB module, users can create their own effects and add them to the filter library. The advantage of the program is also a user-friendly interface and no limitations in the number and resolution of simultaneously edited graphics.
