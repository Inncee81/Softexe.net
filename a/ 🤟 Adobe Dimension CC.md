Adobe Dimension CC is a very easy to use program for creating photorealistic graphics based on models. Felix allows you to easily combine 2D and 3D images, lights and materials, thanks to which you can quickly prepare impressive visualizations of products or photomontages. The program was created for designers, not for specialists in 3D graphics and rendering. There are also no modeling tools.

Dimension CC allows you to prepare photorealistic images to people who have no experience with texturing and lighting models. In the program, simply place the model, drag the materials on it and set the lighting, which can be done in a few simple steps. Dimension CC will automatically detect the horizon and help you set the model in the scene correctly. In addition, for better effect, you can automatically generate lighting based on the background image.
 
 All changes will be seen in real time, allowing you to experiment with the settings and lighting of the model. You can also change the virtual camera that records the image prepared in Dimension CC. Thanks to this, you can choose the perspective, the angle of view and the depth of field. Dimension CC integrates well with Adobe Stock, which greatly facilitates the use of various resources.
 Adobe Dimension CC is only available for those with a Creative Cloud subscription.
