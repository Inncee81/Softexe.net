The application has been equipped with many improvements in relation to its protoplast. With its help, we can easily and conveniently download large amounts of data made available to us by friends or other users via the Internet or local network. It allows you to connect to special servers, so-called hubs that bring together users of the Direct Connect network. Unlike the standard methods of downloading files, it allows you to download data from many different sources at the same time.
 
 AirDC ++ offers the user all the necessary functions and tools designed for efficient downloading of data. Among them, we find options for limiting incoming and outgoing transfers, segmenting files, network statistics, queuing downloaded files, and many others, allowing, for example, communication with users of a given hub. The big advantage of the program are enormous possibilities of configuration of various aspects of his work, and even appearance (support of graphic motifs). 
 
 Unlike its prototype, AirDC ++ allows you to make multiple calls to selected users, has extensive file management features, an advanced mechanism for splitting files into smaller parts, a more efficient search mode for alternative download sources, a convenient wizard for novice users and support for NMDC / ADC protocols. The program also allows you to encrypt data transferred to / from our computer.Attention!
