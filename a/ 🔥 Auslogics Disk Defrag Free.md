The application checks the placement of files and the size of free space on the hard disk, and then proceeds to the optimization. What distinguishes Auslogics Disk Defrag from other such applications is primarily the speed of operation and detailed reports displayed after defragmenting the hard disk. First, indicate the partitions to be optimized, and then click Next.
 
 After this action, Auslogics Disk Defrag automatically starts defragmenting the disk and displays a report of the changes made when it is finished.
 
 Attention!
 During installation, the wizard proposes installing additional components. They are not required for the correct operation of the program and we do not recommend installing them.
