ArCADia RAMA, formerly known as R3D3 - Rama 3D / 2D, is used to perform static calculations of spatial bar systems.

The main assumption of the application is the possibility of convenient, graphical input of data, which is why it is simple and intuitive - we can define the geometry of the system using only the mouse. The introduction of complex systems is facilitated by generators of basic structures (frames, arches). The authors took care of many facilities at the data entry stage, such as, for example, automatic snap to nets and nodes, or the use of predefined profile libraries. In the load range, RAMA allows defining span and rectangular loads applied to the whole bar, transverse and longitudinal loads.
 Loads concentrated in the form of force or moment can be applied to nodes. The program also allows you to define settlement of supports. During the calculation, RAMA can automatically take into account the own weight of the structure.
 
 The installation includes the trial version R3D3-Rama 3D, R2D3-Rama 3D and R2D2-Rama 2D, as well as modules for working with various materials in international and European standards (InterStal, InterDrewno, Euro≈ªelbet, EuroStopa and EuroDrewno).
