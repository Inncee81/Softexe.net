Many times there are situations in which a photo of a given author placed in the network over time is on many websites without giving the source from which the image comes from. To prevent this, we can enter a watermark (in the form of text or image) on the selected graphic using Arclab Watermark Studio. In this way, we will protect against the illegal distribution of our albums or individual photos.
 
 Watermark prepared in Arclab Watermark Studio can both obscure our work and be visible even from a distance, as well as be in a discreet place, only to lightly indicate to whom the photograph or picture belongs. The program also allows you to place multi-layered watermarks and allows you to import image metadata to text on a watermark.
 
 Arclab Watermark Studio can work in batch mode, thanks to which we will put a watermark on multiple files at the same time. Interestingly, the application supports the most popular formats, such as JPEG, PNG TIFF or BMP, and includes the function of resizing and converting images.
