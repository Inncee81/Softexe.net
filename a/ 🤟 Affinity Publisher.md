Affinity Publisher is a DTP composition program designed to compete with Adobe InDesign. Similarly to other Affinity programs, before the release of the stable version, the producer gave us access to the free beta. The program has all the tools you need to submit a document for printing or digital publishing. When creating documents, we can set the paper size, unit of measure and needed margins. By creating and editing a document, you can use well-known tools in the industry - text boxes with effects and rich formatting options, basic graphics editing tools, vector shapes, hand-drawn curves, tables, transparency, gradients, and layer effects. Elements can be placed on layers, grouped, hidden and reordered. You can also use snap (magnet),

Affinity Publisher can import and export PDF, PSD, various graphic and vector formats. Unfortunately, it can not deal with INDD, saved by Adobe InDesign CC, nor IDML from older versions.
