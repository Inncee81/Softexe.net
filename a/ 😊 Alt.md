```sh
Alt1 can be an interesting alternative to the system calculator, especially if in addition to standard calculations, we also perform advanced mathematical operations.
```

After running Alt1, it appears in the system tray, from which we can call it in two ways: either by clicking the program icon with the left mouse button or using the simple "ALT + 1" button combination. Importantly, by entering various values ​​in the program window, we no longer need to click on any confirmation button, because all calculations are done in real time.
 
 Alt1 is shown in the lower right corner of the screen by default, but if you want, you can change the size and position of the window. It is also worth mentioning that icons such as CLR allow to delete all values ​​together with history and hide the program accordingly.
