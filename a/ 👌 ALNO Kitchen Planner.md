The application allows you to design your own kitchen using a rich catalog of manufacturer's furniture, as well as appliances, accessories and additional kitchen equipment. The project can start from scratch or modify one of the example projects. What distinguishes ALNO Kitchen Planner from other free programs is the possibility of greater interference in the appearance of not only furniture but the whole kitchen (floor, walls, lighting, decorations, accessories, etc.).
 
 The most important advantage of the ALNO Kitchen Planner program is a sensational 3D visualization module with lighting simulation, thanks to which projects are very realistic. Ready-made projects in the form of 3D visualization, a 2D project and a list of products can finally be printed.
