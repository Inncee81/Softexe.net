```sh
Adobe Character Animator CC is a 2D animation program in which you just have to move in front of the camera to make the character mimic the animator's movements. All it takes is that the character will have body parts on properly named layers so that you can transfer your own moves to the movie.

Character Animator CC watches the user through the webcam and transfers his movements and facial expressions to the animated character. The program includes a few sample characters that allow you to implement this mechanism. It is worth noting that the program also copes well with the synchronization of the lips of the character to the spoken issues ( lipsync ). 
 
 
 Changes in facial expressions and poses can be observed live. To record an animation, just enable recording in the program. The only thing that needs to be taken care of before, which is preparation on appropriately named layers of different mines for the animated character. 
 
 
 Character Animator CC is part of the Creative Cloud package .
