```sh
Angry Birds Rio is another product that is the result of marketing cooperation in film promotion. As the name suggests, it's about the animated series Rio for children, telling the story of various animals, but with the birds at the forefront. The well-known fun mechanics of the saga of the feathered piglets were remodeled a bit to fit the subject of cinema images produced in 3D technology.

We are still firing a slingshot to get rid of selected goals set in the next stages. Depending on the tasks related to a given part of Rio, it may be a need to break up the cages with imprisoned exotic birds or, say, liquidate the evil monkeys that replace pigs. Of course, in the next levels the player has to deal with more and more complex constructions.
 
 
 Well-known graphic design took on cuts. The heroes are more colorful and a bit larger. Of course, angry birds did not lose their characteristic skills. Blue, for example, is still able to separate in flight, and the yellow quickly run forward to destroy something with impetus. One should appreciate the joyful sound, with music, which was naturally inspired by the audio track from animated films.
 
 Limitations of the trial version
 
 The trial version offers you to play dozens of stages, which the player gradually unlocks. This gives a really big insight into the mechanics of the game.
