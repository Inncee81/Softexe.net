The DNG format has been developed to standardize the ways in which digital camera images are recorded and to bring order to RAW formats. Thanks to the introduction of one open format, all photos from different cameras can be opened in any program that supports DNG, even if it is not equipped with the ability to read files from a given camera.
 
 Adobe DNG Converter handles the processing of RAW files created by most of the most popular cameras and DSLR cameras perfectly. The manufacturer ensures compatibility with over 350 devices of this type. In the tool settings, you can choose compatibility with specific versions of the Camera Raw module, the size of the embedded thumbnail, and you can attach the original RAW file to the file. The program can process whole folders in bulk, preserving their structure.
