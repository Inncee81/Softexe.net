```sh
AutoClose is a free tool that will allow you to close specific programs in accordance with the established work schedule.
```
[![AutoClose](https://gallery.dpcdn.pl/imgc/Tools/85612/g_-_420x350_1.5_-_xd9a98f41-c6cf-4231-bfde-0f6b98964dec.jpg)](https://softexe.net/win/system/control/autoclose:adbf.html)

From the main AutoClose window you get access to the option of creating new tasks. Thanks to them, we will determine when (date and time with the accuracy of the second) or after what time from the start we want to end the operation of the selected application. All tasks are available on a transparent list. After performing AutoClose, if we choose this option earlier, it can end its operation, log out the user, restart the computer, put it to sleep or turn it off.
 
 AutoClose also allows you to prepare so-called "Empty tasks". In this case, we do not set the time when the program will close, but we define other actions, such as restart or complete shutdown of the computer.
