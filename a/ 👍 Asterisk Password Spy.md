The application can be successfully used to recover passwords saved in the operating system, as well as in many popular programs used (eg internet messengers, e-mail clients, etc.). Its service is very simple and is limited to dragging the search icon to the text field with the password.
 
 All passwords disclosed using Asterisk Password Spy are displayed in the main program window. If necessary, it is also possible to export the entire list to an HTML, XML or CSV file.
