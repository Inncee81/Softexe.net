It includes a number of useful functions that significantly improve editorial work. Among them, apart from well-known Objects Styles tools - a set of styles that can be assigned to objects and change their appearance with just one click or Snippets - a solution that allows you to save objects with templates for their presentation and description should be mentioned also Adobe CS Review, which allows creating and sharing online document review.
 
 The CC version is also a Content Collector tool that allows you to store different resources for publication in one repository. The tool is able to collect various types of elements and remember their position in relation to each other in groups. Elements from the set can be put back into the project, individually or in groups, and thus easily modify their layout.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version is available only in the English language version.
