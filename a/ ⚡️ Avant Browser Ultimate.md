The tool is available for free and has been downloaded for any ads (not including those that will appear on the websites you visit, but we can block them using the built-in adblock), not to mention viruses in spyware. Avant Browser Ultimate minimally burdens the resources of our computer, including primarily the processor and RAM (other browsers need much more memory than Avant Browser Ultimate).
 
 Avant Browser Ultimate provides all the features specific to web browsers, and also offers other, additional options. The tool uses mainly modern technologies (Multi-Processing / Anti-Freezing), which make the chance of a "suspension" of the site is practically nil. Even if this happens, one web site will be blocked and the user will have access to the other open tabs.
 
 In addition, we will find here a number of other useful solutions, such as a file download accelerator or the ability to detect video content presented on the site and download them with a single mouse click. Speaking of rodents, they can also be used to perform gestures, thanks to which we will control the browser by "drawing" commands on the screen.
 
 It is also worth mentioning the full-screen mode in Avant Browser Ultimate. After selecting this option, all interface elements are automatically hidden, and in order to gain quick access to them, all you need to do is move the mouse cursor in the right direction. We can also make use of the "full window" mode, which works on the same principle as the full-screen mode, with the difference that here the toolbar remains visible.
