A1 Website Download is a program that allows you to download entire websites to your computer's disk, to gain later access to them offline, without access to the Internet.

The application analyzes all possible links between files that compose a page on the Web and downloads their copies, respectively, in the catalogs. When the download is completed, the user can display the page directly from the system explorer, but he can do it directly from the described application, which has a preview view.
 
 When downloading data, it is possible to intervene in the few options. If we do not feel strong enough to modify them properly, but we would like to adapt the program as well as possible to the type of content downloaded, you can use the templates. They allow you to use the right settings, for example when downloading blogs from WordPress, or articles from Wikipedia, with just one mouse click.
 
 Attention!
 The trial edition was limited to 30 days of operation.
