The tool can be helpful mainly when filling out missing information about songs. It is enough to indicate the files that we want to analyze, and the program will be able to automatically find data about their artists and albums, including downloading covers and assigning downloaded information to files by themselves. Alternatively, you can use the wizard, which helps you to edit the tags manually, giving you access to easily switching between subsequent songs from the catalog.
 
 The program also includes the creation of playlists and the automatic search of duplicates in the music library. Selected songs can also be burned directly from the application on the disc. Most of the activities performed in the program can be applied to many tracks simultaneously, saving a lot of time thanks to group editing.
 
 Attention!
 The free, test version of the program allows simultaneous operation of up to 30 audio files.
