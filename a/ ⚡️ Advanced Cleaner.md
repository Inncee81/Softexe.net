Advanced Cleaner can be a useful add-on for anti-virus software, but in no case should it replace specialized virus-killing applications. Despite everything, the program copes well with broadly understood viruses, including malware and suspicious files.
 
 Advanced Cleaner will delete unnecessary temporary files of the user and unnecessary system data, all Internet browser data and other unnecessary residues, so you will notice that after doing this cleaning the computer will work much more efficiently. However, if we want better results, we can additionally use special option, thanks to which with one click we will increase the speed of the computer and the network connection.
 
 Using Advanced Cleaner, we will also optimize the operation of the web browser by removing unnecessary toolbars and search pages. Therefore, programs such as Firefox or Opera should be characterized by greater stability and speed of work.
 
 Advanced Cleaner also includes the function of optimizing the memory in the computer. The program can clear RAM for each process so as not to slow down the computer. This is especially useful in multitasking when we have many applications open.
