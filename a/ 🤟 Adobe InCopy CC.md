Adobe InCopy is a text composition program for authors and editors. The program allows you to work with text while designers create a layout for it in InDesign.

In InCopy, authors and editors can stylize text, track changes made by others, and modify the layout of the document. The program allows you to work with tables, headers, footers and in many ways to stylize, color and shade the text. Here you can also insert hyperlinks. These changes are independent of the layout that designers working in InDesign will prepare for the text. 
 
 
 InCopy lets you work with OpenType fonts and integrates with Adobe Typekit. The program allows you to work comfortably with single glyphs and preview the edited text in many ways in different views and gives you full control over it.
