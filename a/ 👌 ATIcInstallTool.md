> ATIc Install Tool is a tool used to find and install the latest AMD Radeon graphics drivers.

Of course, these drivers can be found manually via the official website of the equipment manufacturer, but usually this operation takes a lot of time, as it requires going through many screens. ATIc Install Tool automatically detects your computer's operating system (you can also indicate it manually), and the user decides himself whether he wants to install new drivers or suspend the update.
 
 Interestingly, thanks to the ATIc Install Tool, we can download not only the latest, but also older drivers. This option is for advanced recipients who want to check the operation of a given application (e.g. a computer game) on previous settings and compare them with the new version.
