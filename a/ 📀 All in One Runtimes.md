The described tool saves a lot of time on the part of the user, who does not have to search for individual components on the Internet, but can download them from one place in the form of a set. All in One Runtimes is very easy to use and its operation is limited to just a few clicks, which makes the program also addressed to less experienced recipients. Interestingly, the installer detects already available components, so they will not be installed again.
 
 All in One Runtimes includes: NET Framework 4.6 + add-ons, Java Runtime Environment 8, additional DirectX 9.0c files, general executable files, Microsoft Visual C ++ Runtimes (v2005 - v2015), Microsoft Visual J # 2.0 SE, Microsoft Silverlight 5, Adobe Flash Player (Opera, Firefox, Internet Explorer) and Shockwave Player 12 (Internet Explorer plug-in).
