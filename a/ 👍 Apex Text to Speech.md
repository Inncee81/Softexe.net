Apex Text to Speech is a very easy to use tool that offers the ability to convert text to speech.

After typing or copying the text to the main window of the Apex Text to Speech program, it is enough to click the "speak" button, so that the computer lector (two voices to choose) read the next words. This is not the end, because the application allows you to save the whole statement to a WAV audio file, which we can then recreate at a later date on a computer or a suitable portable device (eg an MP3 player).
 
 Apex Text to Speech allows you to play text placed in Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel, text documents, PDFs, ebooks, websites and more. Interestingly, at any moment we can pause and resume the voice of the teacher.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
