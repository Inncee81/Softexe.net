> AutoHDR is a program for creating HDR effects in pictures. The application uses algorithms that can extract details from shadows from the photo and properly darken the highlighted areas to get the title effect.

The interface may seem less modern, but its simplicity translates into ease of use. In addition, it does not distract the user's eyes, which can focus on analyzing the effects visible in the picture. When editing graphics, along with the change in the values ​​of individual parameters, a preview window is generated in a small window, which can be moved to any other elements of the image. All the photo is processed only after manually running this process, to save time during modification.
 
 The program allows interfering in such parameters as contrast, color saturation, noise, sharpness, shadows, details, brightness. It is possible to use typical settings schemes adapted to the scenery of the edited photo, for example landscape photography or vehicles.
 
 Attention!
 
 The program does not require installation.
