The program is characterized by high quality of output files and support for the most popular formats including DivX, XviD, MOV, RM, RMVB, MPEG, VOB, DVD, WMV, AVI, MPEG-I, DVD NTSC, DVD PAL, Flash for Video (FLV), AVI Video and WMV. The big advantage of Any Video Converter is the conversion function not only to formats intended for a computer or DVD devices, but also for mobile phones. For the MP4 format, the authors have prepared a lot of configuration options for sound and video, e.g. video size, audio sampling, etc.
 
 In addition to the video conversion functionality, the tool has options that allow you to freely change the size of the image in the output material, and cut and include only selected portions of the file when you work. With the help of Any Video Converter, we also merge several clips into one video.
 
 The application does not have a problem processing many different video files into one specified format. Any Video Converter also has implemented the preview option of movies before conversion in real time and the function of downloading movies from YouTube and Google Video.
