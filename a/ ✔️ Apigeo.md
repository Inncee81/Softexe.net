Map for free
 
 For free, we can draw vector maps in the standard bases BDOT500, GESUT, EGiB, BDSOG, PRPOG, PRG, at various scales, as well as in accordance with the instructions K1-1998r. We create the map by plotting cartographic signs to which the search engine is located, where we enter part of the description or code to find the character or to run a function to draw it. Drawing a character can also be run from the command line Cada by typing, its code, eg KTCR02, or the name CHODNIK. This second option is very convenient. We do not have to search for a sign, know the code, just enter simple names and map. In addition to the map there are options to create a sectional frame, a grid of crosses with a description, lines delimiting the purpose in the local land development plan with a description, and the building line.
 
 Sketches for free
 The program also includes a set of free tools for developing field sketches, such as:
 
 ManupunktManager - a point management program that we divide into groups and subgroups. By default, the program has 6 Center, Calculation, Design, Measure, Sketch and Operative groups implemented. You can also create your own point groups.
 Leaders - a tool for inserting headers on a sketch
 Measurement line - tool for plotting measuring lines on a sketch
 Well Card Generator
 Program for creating field sketches from sewage inventory
 Border signs
 
 Automation of the surveyor's work
 
 In addition to the free tools, the program includes paid modules:
 Automatic machine for calculating data for stakeout building in the field
 A program for creating GPS reports
 Program for generating a technical leveling measurement log
 Tools for processing GML files
 
 Apigeo works without any problems with other installed plug-ins under CAD. Currently only with the AutoCAD x64 platform from version 2013 to 2019 or later. In subsequent updates, BricsCAD, ZwCAD + will be added.
