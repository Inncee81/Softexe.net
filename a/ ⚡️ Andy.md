The program has been designed so that its users can feel just like the owners of Android phones. Andy offers an interface well-known from smartphones, and also allows you to use the Google Play store, where you will find not only hundreds of games and programs (including free ones). After downloading, we will run them from the desktop of our operating system without any problem.
 
 Similarly to other tools of this type, Andy allows you to configure a smartphone that will act as a wireless controller during the game. You can also use Xbox or PlayStation controllers. In addition, the program also supports multi-touch technology and allows you to assign keys to customize the control system to your liking.
 
 In the case of mobile devices, we must reckon with the fact that the space on the memory card will end very quickly - using the Andy program, you can afford to install a much larger number of applications than on your smartphone. This allows you to quickly check the games or programs you are interested in using the PC without having to install them on your phone.
