> Assassin's Creed Pirates is a side game from the Assassin's Creed series. Under no circumstances should it be compared with Assassin's Creed Origins or other titles published for PCs and Xbox One and PlayStation 4 consoles, because Assassin's Creed Pirates has been transferred to computers from smartphones and tablets.

You play as a young and ambitious captain. Alonzo Batilla will set out to find the legendary treasure of pirate Olivier Levasseur (La Buse) located somewhere in the Caribbean. During his journey he will take part in the conflict between the assassins and the Templars, meeting the most famous pirates on the road, including Sam Bellamy, Blackbeard and Ben Hornigold. Assassin's Creed Pirates contains over 50 historical missions and side missions, 100 treasures to find and many other attractions.
 
 
 Assassin's Creed Pirates should appeal to fans of sea battles known for example from Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag or Assassin's Creed Rogue, because it's the focus of the game on them. In the Caribbean we will use different types of weapons, destroying enemy ships and taking various treasures. Initially, our boat will be of poor quality, but over time we will unlock better and better ships, which we will modernize. We will recruit crew members and unblock new pirate techniques.
