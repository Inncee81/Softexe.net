The Pro version offers the most extensive functionality of the already valued ACID tool for creating music based on the so-called loops - short, several-tone sound fragments. The program also allows multitrack sound recording and offers the functions of a MIDI sequencer.
 
 ACID Pro can be used both to create new compositions, and to mix and remix existing ones. It is often used to create a sound setting for movies, multimedia presentations or for the Internet. The full version of the program contains 1000 loops.
