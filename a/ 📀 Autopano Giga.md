Using the application, we can glue different images into one whole and create professional panoramas - spherical, cylindrical, mosaic or planar. Autopano Giga also allows you to combine images in larger graphic formats that were taken with standard and wide-angle lenses. 
 
 
 The program is characterized by extreme simplicity and speed when creating and rendering panoramic photos, as well as an extensive editor to modify various panoramas. With its help, we can crop pictures, perform color correction (HDR, LDR) and exposure, set the level of brightness, contrast and shadow, and modify other elements of the panorama without losing its quality. 
 
 
 Autopano Giga supports about 400 different graphic formats, including RAW files, and also allows you to save created panoramas in the following formats - JPG, PNG, TIFF, HDR, KRO or EXR. In addition, it also allows you to export panoramic photos with layers, for later processing in Adobe Photoshop. 
 
 Attention!
 The program is available in a trial version and has numerous limitations that make it impossible to save projects in .PANO format and export photos to the Panotools service. In addition, watermarks with the program name will be covered in the preview window and in the panorama images you have created.
