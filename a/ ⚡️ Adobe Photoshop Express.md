The application offers a set of basic tools that are perfect for amateur photo editing. We find among them functions designed to impose on the image color themes, crop and rotate photos by a given angle, manipulating such attributes as exposure, contrast, backlight, shadows, temperature, shade, brightness or saturation.
 
 Adobe Photoshop Express also offers a set of usable graphic effects as well as features for sharpening and reducing noise (luminance and colors). There were also tools for removing red eye and edge management. 
 
 The program is characterized by a very simple operation, which is certainly influenced by the refined graphic interface and the availability of the Polish language version. Most machining operations are based on the choice of the finished effect and the management of its intensity through the slider. For amateurs, self-correcting options have been prepared that can automatically select the best settings for a particular photo.
