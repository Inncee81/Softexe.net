Advanced Uninstaller Pro is a powerful uninstaller for Windows-based applications that allows you to quickly and completely remove programs using a simple and intuitive interface. This program keeps track of all changes performed on the computer during the installation of the software, and thus, during uninstallation, it eliminates all the changes that are made, which allows you to "get rid" of installed applications once and for all without a trace.

In addition, it can remove many other elements that ordinary uninstallers cannot cope with. This utility can restore or delete broken registry entries, clear the Start menu non-functioning shortcuts, remove toolbars (toolbars) and plugins in browsers, remove fonts, cancel programs launch in the system tray, etc.

Moreover, it helps to preserve the confidentiality of users when working on the Internet, clearing the cache of browsed pages and the history of open documents. The functionality of the application is quite diverse and contains all the necessary tools to fully manage the installed applications and save the computer system from littering. The program interface is intuitive and clear that it is not difficult to master it even for inexperienced users.
