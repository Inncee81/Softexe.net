The functionality offered by the program allows you to conveniently archive the contents of almost all commonly used data carriers. The disk images created with it can be used to restore valuable files for us if a computer crashes. Active @ Disk Image is equipped with tools that can create backups of entire disks (full or incremental backups), restore them at a given moment, create RAW copies containing an exact copy of all disk sectors, verify the correctness of archived data or copy the contents of a given partition to another disk.
 
 In addition to the aforementioned functions, the developers of the tools also offer us a file explorer with previously created disk images and virtual drive options in which they can be mounted and operated in Windows as standard partitions. Active @ Disk Image also has tools for creating bootable media for restoring data, managing partitions, automating program work (task scheduling), creating scripts and browsing log files.
 
 The program, despite its large possibilities, remains a simple and user-friendly solution. Almost all functions available in it are handled from the level of built-in wizards, which guide us step by step throughout the whole process of the operation being performed. Despite the lack of the Polish language version, its service should not cause any problems to anyone.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 21 days.
