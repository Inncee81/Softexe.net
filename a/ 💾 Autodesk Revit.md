Autodesk Revit is a professional program for building modeling and building information (BIM) in pre-loaded formats. In addition, Revit has the possibilities of architectural design, MEP engineering and construction, and the possibility of parametric design.

Revit supports the entire design process from concept to construction and gives you a wide range of team work opportunities. Sharing resources allows different people in the team to work on the same project at the same time. Bidirectional element connections cause that changes made in one of the views will be introduced globally, in every place where the modified object appears. 
 
 
 When creating an architectural project, Revit allows you to start with conceptual design, ie sketches and models. In further stages, it allows you to precisely model, work with perspective, plan the area around buildings and render visualizations locally or in the cloud. Locally, Revit can use its own Autodesk Raytracer renderer or third-party tools. 
 
 
 In Revit, engineers can plan reinforcements in detail, including variable density and atypical shapes, perform vertical load analysis and check the strength of the structure. There are also tools that allow you to prepare designed elements for production, for example, suspensions and plumbing and electrical installations, and prepare documentation.
 
 
 Autodesk Revit integrates with other Autodesk services and the A360 cloud. 
 
 
 Revit in the trial version works for 30 days. Students can get a free 3-year license for the program.
