The application has a very simple and aesthetic graphical interface, which was made in accordance with the pixel art technique and which can be associated by older users with the first operating systems with a graphical user interface. Despite this, it has a set of tools and functions that would not be ashamed of many more complex graphics programs.
 
 Within Aseprite we find, among others card mechanism, allowing simultaneous work with multiple images, options for convenient manipulation of the color palette and the size of our project or layer functions, with the help of which it is possible to create more complex images composed of many objects independent of each other.
 
 The Aseprite tool in the 0.9.5 free version has been released for Windows, Linux and Mac OS. It is disseminated in a portable form (so-called portable) that does not require installation - the application is ready for operation right after downloading.
