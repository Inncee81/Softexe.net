The software allows the user to work in 2D and 3D mode. At his disposal, an intuitive wizard was given, giving the ability to easily define the basic parameters of the project, such as the dimensions of the rooms, the number of floors or others, such as the roof structure. Using Ashampoo Home Designer Pro, we will design rooms of various types.
 
 Thanks to the built-in catalog of objects, we will arrange, among others living room, bedrooms, bathroom, kitchen, etc. In the hands of the user a set of such elements as doors, windows, stairs, electrical installations, fireplaces, carpets and many others was given. The tool also has the ability to manipulate the area around the designed house. Offered topographies include hill, lowlands, riverbed, road, terrace and water reservoir.
 
 Ashampoo Home Designer Pro also includes many advanced mechanisms that influence the overall appearance of the project. Among them was an extensive lighting mechanism and a convenient camera system, allowing you to view the effects of our work from any perspective in a 3D view.
 
 Attention!
 
 By default, the trial version allows you to use the program for 10 days. Free registration on the manufacturer's website allows you to extend this period by another 20 days.
