> Amazon Cloud Drive is a small application for hosting cloud offered by Amazon. Thanks to it, we will not only download files from the server to your computer, but also add new files to the cloud.

The program is extremely easy to use. After installation, all you need to do is enter your details into your Amazon account to access files stored in the cloud. One of the buttons placed in the interface allows you to download all files, adding new ones is done by selecting folders of interest, or dragging data to the program window.
 
 The application interface is available in English and although it is free, it requires a subscription on Amazon Cloud Drive to fully operate. Free account only allows you to download already saved data such as books sent to Kindle readers. In order to send new files, you must purchase an annual subscription to store photos or files of any type.
