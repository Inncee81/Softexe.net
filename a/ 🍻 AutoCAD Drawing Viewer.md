AutoCAD Drawing Viewer will work as a program for printing drawings. Thanks to it, we will also export files to JPG and PDF formats from available projects, we will convert drawings (DWG, DWF or DXF), browse, as well as edit, search and overwrite various values. Importantly, the tool can convert drawings in batch mode, thanks to which we will save a lot of time in a situation when we have to change the format of many projects.
 
 It is worth noting that AutoCAD is not required for the described tool. In addition, AutoCAD Drawing Viewer is compatible with all versions of AutoCAD.
