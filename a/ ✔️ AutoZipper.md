Sometimes we place many different documents in one archive, and after making changes in a given text, it is necessary to find all the materials again in order to add them again to the compressed set. This process can be significantly simplified and accelerated using the AutoZipper program.
 
 After launching AutoZipper, a window will appear on the screen in which we will name your project, determine the path of recording (the task itself and the ZIP file), and - of course - we will add selected files to the archive. When we make a change in one or more of them, we will no longer have to create an archive from scratch. It's enough to open a list of projects in AutoZipper and then use the "run" function.
 
 AutoZipper offers the possibility to add only files, directories or entire folder structures to the project.
