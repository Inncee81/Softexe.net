The tool allows you to play gifs (directly from the main program window or by right-clicking on the selected file, because AniView integrates with the Windows Explorer) and allows you to stop them at any time using spaces. 
 
 In addition, AniView includes a function that allows all frames of a given GIF file to be exported to the selected destination path, where it will be saved as graphics in PNG format. 
 
 AniView provides numerous skins and other options, thanks to which the user can customize the appearance of the main window of the described application to his own preferences.
