Unlike many other word processors, the Amazon Storywriter does not require installation on a computer, and the use of this program is done using a web browser. Nevertheless, the creators made sure that the user would have access to their works also offline. After reconnecting to the network, the changes will be automatically synchronized.
 
 Amazon Storywriter allows you to share your work with other trusted readers, and also allows you to send them to Amazon Studios, which produces award-winning series and appreciated movies. Before sending the script, we will not have to worry about the correct formatting of the text, because the application performs the required operations in this area automatically, which means that we can focus on creating your work, not editing the document.
 
 It is worth noting that individual documents created in the Amazon Storywriter can be read on any device (eg smartphone or tablet). There is also the possibility of importing files to the described tool saved in FDX, Fountain, PDF or RTF formats, so if we started writing a script in another program, we can continue to work using the Amazon Storywriter.
 
 Attention!
 
 The program requires you to create or log in to your Amazon account. Creating an account is free.
