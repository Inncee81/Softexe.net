While surfing the Internet, we are constantly exposed to numerous threats. In addition to the standard viruses on the computer hard disk without our knowledge may appear spyware (key loggers or tools to create screenshots of the desktop computer), malware or Trojan horses. If you want to increase your security in the network, you can install AOL Shield, which is designed to protect you.
 
 AOL Shield is especially useful when we repeatedly share your confidential data in the network - for example when using a bank account or various social networking sites. Special technology offers real-time encryption and hides data entered on the keyboard (e.g. passwords), so that they can not be intercepted by unauthorized persons.
