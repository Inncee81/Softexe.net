The program interface resembles the start menu from Windows 8 - contains groups and tiles of individual options that the user can set according to their own preferences. The main component of Ashampoo ZIP Pro is a file compression module. It allows you to handle formats such as ZIP, RAR, TAR, CAB and 7-Zip. No problem is encrypted data using the AES algorithm and a user-defined password, the choice of the method and level of compression, as well as the division of the archive into files of defined dimensions, eg CDs or DVDs. Decompression, in turn, supports up to 40 different file types, including ISO disc images. If we do not want to unpack them, we can use the built-in virtual drive manager, because there is a place even for such an option.
 
 The possibilities of the program do not end there. It allows you to create so-called ZIP scripts which, when run, cause backup of specific files and save it to the selected location. Copies can be compressed and encrypted. The Encryption Suite module also allows you to encrypt any files and folders on the disk using OpenPGP. The package allows you to manage encryption keys, sign and verify files, as well as integration with the Office package and PDF documents. From its level you can generate RSA keys (even 8192 bits), ElGamal and ECDH, and export them to servers holding public keys.
 
 If it's not enough for someone, it's worth mentioning that Ashampoo ZIP Pro also allows you to repair files and archives, convert them between different formats, as well as to integrate with Internet clouds - it is possible to connect to Azure, Amazon S3, Dropbox , Google Drive, OneDrive and Box for both viewing and data transfer, and the use of this type of location for saving backups. The program is available in the full Polish language version.
 
 The producer also provides a limited, but free edition of the Ashampoo ZIP Free application .
