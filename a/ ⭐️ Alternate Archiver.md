Alternate Archiver is a kind of file manager that contains all the necessary functions and tools for working with files and restoring order on your PC. Here you can rename, copy, delete, move and sort files, change the time they were created, search and do many other operations.

Separately, it is worth highlighting the option of archiving data: an archive with files can be made by date (month, year) or the initial letters in the file name. In addition, there is an option to synchronize the contents of the two marked directories, which is convenient for maintaining a backup database with data. For reliability, the developers have provided a tool to completely erase files (shredder) without the possibility of their subsequent recovery even with specialized software.

In general, Alternate Archiver is a very good alternative to both file managers like Windows Explorer and various archivers, combining these functions in one convenient and intuitive graphical environment.
