Aptana is an IDE environment for creating websites (HTML, CSS, XML), in which a strong emphasis is placed on the AJAX / Java Script technology. The program was written in Java, thanks to which it is very flexible and can be run on various system platforms (Windows, Linux). It has functions such as syntax highlighting, error verification, and auto-completion of the code. In addition, it shows in which browsers a given tag is supported.
 
 The application includes popular AJAX libraries, among others AFLAX, Dojo, MochiKit, Prototype, Rico or Yahoo UI.The authors on the specially prepared website aptana.tv provide very interesting screencasts demonstrating the possibilities of the application. Video materials are a very good reading that introduces not only the secrets of Aptana functionality, but also programming itself.
