Alcohol 120% is a powerful program for burning CD / DVD / Blu-ray discs, creating virtual drives on a computer and emulating data from an optical disc. This application can burn a disk image with data, audio or video information to a hard drive (hard drive, USB flash drive), and then provide access to this data to other programs as if the desired optical disc is actually in the drive. This is especially true for many computer games that run only from the disk.

In addition, placing a disk image as a specific archive on a computer is much more reliable than storing data on regular CD / DVD / Blu-ray discs. Therefore, this program can also be viewed as an application for backing up information: in case the optical disc is damaged due to damage, you can always record a new image from the PC.

Interestingly, here you can create up to 31 virtual drives and work with each of them simultaneously. This solves the problem of replacing a standard optical drive with a software method, in which, in principle, the CD / DVD drive itself is needed only for the initial creation of a disk image.

If you still use various optical discs in work, school, and entertainment and need regular copying / writing / erasing them, then Alcohol 120% will help you with this task - perform all operations with discs at your discretion. Present and recording quality control function.

The main features of the application:


Create up to 31 virtual drives (using SCSI Pass Through Direct (SPTD) layer).
Creation of CD, DVD and Blu-ray disc images, MDF / MDS, CCD, BIN / CUE, ISO, CDI, BWT, B5T, B6T, BWI, BWS, BWA, ISZ image formats are supported.
Burn images of CD, DVD and Blu-ray discs.
Direct copy from disk to disk.
Erasing information from CD-RW, DVD-RW and BD-RE discs.
Search for disk image files on a computer.
Export and import of image file lists.


It is worth paying your attention to the additional free version of the program called Alcohol 52%, which differs only in the lack of the ability to burn CDs and DVDs.
