Articulate Studio is a suite of tools that allow you to create professional e-learning courses at a very fast pace.

The whole consists of four programs: Articulate Presenter '13 (preparation of extensive presentations), Articulate Quizmaker '13 (creating quizzes, surveys and surveys), Articulate Engage '13 (introducing interactive elements into courses without having to know the programming principles) and Articulate Replay ( conversion of presentations available in various formats to flash format). 
 
 Each tool included in the Articulate Studio package is available in two editions: standard and professional. As a result, they can be used by both more demanding and novice users who plan to take care of creating e-learning courses.
 
 Articulate Studio, though it is divided into several separate programs, is in fact one whole. Individual tools from this set are closely related and constructed so that the user can easily transfer content created in one application to another (eg importing video to Articulate Replay and converting material to flash format, and then placing it in a presentation created using Articulate Presenter '13).
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
