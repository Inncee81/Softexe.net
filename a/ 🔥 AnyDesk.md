AnyDesk is an excellent innovative application from the team of German developers AnyDesk Software for remote access to the computer you need. A distinctive feature of this tool is the high performance of the connection, which allows you to administer efficiently, quickly, conveniently and comfortably on a remote machine without visible delays.

Now there is no need to constantly copy something from your PC to use the necessary information somewhere on the road or on a business trip: AnyDesk provides easy access to all files, folders, photos, music, etc. on your home, office or work machine. And all this is done in an intuitive and simple interface without the need for complicated configuration, which even an absolute beginner can handle without the basics of administration.

The developers promise that the TLS 1.2 technology used in this program will ensure complete confidentiality and security of access to a remote PC, and two-way encrypted authorization ensures that the connection will be made to the required workplace.

In general, AnyDesk opens up really ample opportunities to use not only as a simple access to your files from another PC, but also allows you to conduct productive teamwork on the Internet, or to significantly simplify the process of setting up and configuring remote computers to system administrators when there is no way to do it directly.
