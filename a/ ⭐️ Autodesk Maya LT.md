Maya LT has been prepared for modeling and animating elements that can be useful in games - above all characters, tools for them and environments. We will, of course, find well-known and valued tools, such as NURBS solids, subdivisions and the same carving tools as in the original. There are also high-quality tools optimizing models for mobile games, allowing simplifying the grids and choosing the level of detail of the models.
 
 
 Non-linear animation tools allow you to easily enter deformations such as twisting, bending, waving, bending, tapered, crumpling or stretching. Maya LT also has tools for rapid texture preparation for models, with the ability to transfer them between high resolution and low resolution models. Resources can be exported directly to Unity and Unreal , Mudbox environments as well as Autodesk Stingray environments. 
 
 
 When modeling, you can use the ability to create skeletons and attach them to specific points of the model's grid. For humanoid characters, you can use the HumanIK automatic rigging system. 
 
 
 The program can be tested for 30 days. Maya LT is available in the subscription model, with unpaid operating as a free model browser. Together with the modeling program, the Stingray environment will be installed. Students can get a 3-year license for free.
