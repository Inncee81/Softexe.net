> Appy Text is a minimalist text editor that allows you to focus entirely on your work.

This application can be an interesting alternative to Notepad. It contains several useful options not available in the tool that is an integral part of the Windows operating system. I am talking about the support of Markdown markup language, two ways of displaying text (focus mode and reading mode) and the function of jumping to the next word. Appy Text also allows you to share content via email.
 
 Appy Text is available not only in the PC version, but it was also released in the edition for smartphones and tablets, which was adapted to these portable devices. Each edition of the program consumes very little system resources and can boast a modern, transparent user interface.
 
 Attention!
 
 Appy Text can be downloaded for free, but a large part of the feature has been reserved only for people who decide to purchase the Premium version (you can use it for free for 30 days).
