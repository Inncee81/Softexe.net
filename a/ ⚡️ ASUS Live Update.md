ASUS Live Update is a tool that makes it much easier to update drivers and BIOS in selected Asus devices. It can automatically search for these components on official servers, and if new versions are detected, also install them.

After launching the program is available from the system level of the tray in the form of a small icon. Clicking it brings up the main program window, in which we can configure automatic checking of the availability of new software versions. In some cases, for example, updating the BIOS may require the installation of an additional utility.
