The program gives us the ability to record an image containing a full screen, a fixed area, space around the mouse cursor and video material from any external device (eg webcam). In addition, it has been equipped with tools for creating screenshots and capturing only the audio track from the recording. By default, the image is saved to WMV files, but thanks to the built-in converter it's easy to convert them to AVI, MP4, FLV, SWF and other formats.
 
 Apowersoft Screen Recorder Pro has an integrated task scheduler that allows you to automate the process of video recording. In addition, the application offers many useful functions to personalize your recordings. It is possible, among others hiding icons on the desktop, taskbar, and mouse cursor. There were also program support using keyboard shortcuts.
 
 Attention!
 
 The test version allows you to register material with a maximum length of 3 minutes. In addition, a watermark is applied to the image, and the conversion option allows you to convert only 1 minute from each video file.
