Affinity Photo is a program for editing raster graphics, and above all, calling and retouching photos and assembling photomontages. Affinity Photo quite well handles opening and saving Photoshop files (PSD), as well as RAWs from various digital cameras, along with color profiles and lens geometry for many of them.

The Affinity Photo window has been divided into specific tasks: calling, post-production, forming, tone mapping (HDR) and export. The development module has been equipped not only with the possibility of color correction and detail extraction, but also allows you to improve the camera's imperfections, remove distortions and aberrations, and take advantage of advanced image stuttering.
 
 
 The program offers very good quality tools, with the help of which you can successfully retouch your photos or prepare graphics for publication on the Web. The program allows you to work in RGB, CMYK, LAB and grayscale spaces, in depth 16 bits per channel, with the ability to manage ICC profiles. 
 
 Noteworthy are also very fast tools for retouching, including the possibility of smoothing the skin of the photographed people with frequency separation and a classic set: cloning brush, spotting and patching. Even advanced distortions and perspective correction work instantly. Working with brushes is also very fast thanks to the author's painting engine. It allows for precise preview and full control over the dynamics of strokes. 
 
 
 In addition to the ability to import and export Photoshop files, Affinity Photo also allows you to work with images in the following formats: PNG, TIFF, JPG, GIF, SVG, EPS and PDF. The files can use an unlimited number of layers, masks, effects and filters, which in turn can be transformed without losing quality. The history of changes is always saved with the file, so even after opening the document, you can withdraw the actions you have taken. 
 
 
 In addition to advanced job opportunities with photos, Affinity Photo also gives you access to basic vector and text tools.
