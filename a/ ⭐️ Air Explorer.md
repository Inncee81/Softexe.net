```sh
Air Explorer is an unusual file explorer that allows you to manage both local files and collected in various cloud-based network services in one place. The program supports the most popular accounts of this type and allows to significantly facilitate the work with many such services at the same time.

With this small application we have the ability to collect information from many clouds and view the data contained on them without having to constantly log in and switch between services. Just add your chosen account to Air Explorer, enter user data and we can enjoy the integration of all accounts in one place. Thanks to this, managing the content of each cloud becomes much easier and faster. The application interface, which was clearly built for classic content management methods, such as Windows Explorer, helps.
 
 Among the supported services, at present we can connect the following accounts to Air Explorer: 4Shared, Adrive Premium, Baidu, Box, Copy, DropBox, FTP servers, GoogleDrive, MediaFire, Mega, OneDrive, WebDav and Yandex. Further services can be added via the plug-in system, and further updates will probably introduce integration with the most desirable clouds.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version of the program has some limitations, among which one should mention the lack of data encryption, the ability to service one versus within a given service, the transfer of a maximum of 5 files simultaneously and the lack of possibility to secure the tool with a password.
