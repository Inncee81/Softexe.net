The program provides very good digital equivalents of oil paints, watercolors, airbrushes, rapitographs, pencils, oil pastels, markers and oil pastels. There are also auxiliary tools, such as a spatula, an eraser, a tube of paint and brocade, a palette for mixing colors and the unique Gloop pen- a tool similar to a nib with transparent ink, which you can make "blots" and interesting outlines. There were also typically digital tools, such as cloning, color sampler, selection, layers and the ability to transform an already drawn image. The program also allows painting symmetrical with respect to several axes. The tools are imitated in a very realistic way, it allows you to mix paints already in the drawing and to overlap different tools, and yet the program is relatively light. As a substrate, you can choose several types of paper and canvas.
 
 ArtRage since version 4.5 makes full use of the potential of graphic tablets, including the angle of inclination of the pen and the recognition of the operation of the wheel on the feathers imitating the airbrush. Depending on the speed of the brush movement, the paint is applied with varying intensity, the thickness of the pencil drawn line or the transparency of the marker line changes. If the tablet supports tilt detection, the program can use it to draw and also change the angle of the virtual pencil or the direction of the airbrush nozzle.
 
 Drawing with the use of a reference image can be done in two ways - it can be placed next to the canvas or "placed" under the work area. The program can automatically select colors from the underlying image. 
 
 
 Attention!
 
 As a trial version, version 4.0 of the program is still available. Owners of the full version 4.0 can download the free update to 4.5 from the manufacturer's website . 
 
 
 The trial version has limited options for saving and exporting images, but allows you to try all available tools.
