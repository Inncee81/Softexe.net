The program, unlike other solutions of this type, gives the possibility of detailed configuration of each test performed. In addition to the basic settings of the data block size used during the testing process, it also allows to define, among others, the level of data compression, thus simulating the operation of various types of applications. Anvil's Storage Utilities is very easy to use, requires no installation and allows you to view the information collected by the system's WMI mechanism.
 
 The results of tests carried out using the tool can be saved in the form of a screenshot in PNG format.
