AutoMapa is the most popular satellite navigation program in Poland that allows you to set routes. Thanks to the cooperation with the GPS receiver, it allows you to set the position with an accuracy of several meters, and also allows you to dynamically set a new route after running off of the designated one.

AutoMapa offers very detailed and often updated maps (including street directives, entry bans, etc.), aesthetic visualizations of the route (also three-dimensional), voice prompts of different lectors, the ability to route different types (the shortest, the fastest, etc.). A very large advantage of the program is an extremely extensive and constantly updated POI database (points of interest). AutoMapa allows you to choose intermediate points, calculate the length of the route and travel time, as well as many others.Attention!
 
 The demo version of the program includes full functionality, but has sections of the original AutoMapa maps.
 To install the program, enter: DEMOPOLSKA in the License field.
