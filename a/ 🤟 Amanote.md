> Amanote is an interesting tool that can facilitate learning or presentation of various issues by adding notes to individual slides.

After launching Amanote, use the drag-and-drop technique to open a project saved in PPT, AMA or PDF format. We will see it on the next pages on the left side of the screen. On the right, you can enter a variety of notes related to a given slide using the built-in text editor. This is not the end, because each slide can be commented, as well as any graphic, graph, mathematical or chemical formulas, as well as pictorial drawings. In addition, we will highlight the key information with a highlighter.
 
 Amanote allows you to export individual notes to PDF format, and allows them to be shared with friends, family members or employees via a previously generated code. If we work at home and outside of it, we have the option to synchronize your notes between various devices by using the data storage service "in the cloud".
