The program was created from scratch for quick and convenient design of applications without programming. You can move between the view of the visual design and the prototype of the application and run it to test your ideas. Many tasks, such as creating nets or duplicating screens, have been automated. Changes are made in real time. In addition, you can create skeletons and instantly share projects with other team members using Adobe Creative Cloud solutions.
 
 
 The tools in Adobe Experience Design CC allow you to create your own elements or use materials from other programs, with special regard to Adobe Stock and resources in the Creative Cloud. The program allows you to test exactly how the elements of the interface will behave, check the animations and different ways of interaction. What's more, after connecting your phone to your computer, you can test the application on a real mobile screen.
 
 
 To download the program you have to log in using Adobe ID or create a new account. You do not need to pay the Creative Cloud subscription.
