Artlantis Render is an independent engine rendering photorealistic, physically correct images, designed for architects and interior designers. Its great advantage is the ability to make changes in the lighting of the scene in real time in the preview window.

Artlantis Render allows you to work with natural and artificial light (IES, neon and many others), with natural lighting can be adjusted to the time of year and day. We can choose between spatial and perspective cameras as well as post-production effects such as vignettes, white balance settings and photographic filters. 
 
 
 Thanks to the availability of data export plugins for other programs, Artlantis Render can work with many modeling tools, such as 3ds Max, Maya, SketchUp, AutoCad, Revit, Lightwave, Rhino, ArchiCAD and others. Artlantis Render reads DXF, DWG, DWF, OBJ, FBX and 3ds formats, whereas in the latter case Artlantis is able to retrieve some information about textures and light sources. 
 
 
 Artlantis Render in the trial version works for 30 days from the first launch. Since the Studio version differs in that it is not possible to render animations and interactive panoramas for VR goggles.
