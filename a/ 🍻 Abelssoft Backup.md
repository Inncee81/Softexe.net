The program allows you to back up specific types of documents including graphics, music and video files, text documents, PowerPoint presentations, emails etc. as well as selected folders or specific files. Backups can be created both manually and automatically.
 
 Any backup created with the Abelssoft Backup program can be password protected. In addition, archived data can be viewed and retrieved from them only selected files or directories. Undoubtedly, the biggest advantage of the tool outside of the simple graphical interface is the speed of action. The application allows archiving data at speeds up to 90 MB / s. Of course, the speed depends on the capacity and speed of the hard disk.
 
 Abelssoft Backup has also been equipped with backup functions for the entire operating system. To create a copy of the whole system, a Boot CD must be created in advance. The created copy can be extremely useful when the system stops running. By running the computer from the previously prepared bootable disk, Abelssoft Backup allows you to restore the copy of the partition.
