The program was created from scratch for quick and convenient application design. You can quickly move between viewing the visual design and the application prototype to test your ideas. Many tasks, like creating nets, have been automated. Changes are made in real time. In addition, you can create skeletons and instantly share projects with other team members. 
 
 
 Tools in Adobe Experience Design CC allow you to draw, and in many ways, use and modify the provided components when creating interactive prototypes. The program allows you to test exactly how the elements of the interface will behave, check the animations and different ways of interaction. Resources can be immediately prepared for production use and ready application.
