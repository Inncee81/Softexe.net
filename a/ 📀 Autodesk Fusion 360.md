> Autodesk Fusion 360 is a complete, though simple solution for product design. In addition to modeling, you can perform a simulated strength test and prepare parts for production. Fusion 360 also allows team work and file sharing in the cloud.

Fusion 360 provides a complete collection of modeling tools, including sculpting, creating parametric models, working with voxels and a solid mesh. Parts and additional materials can be stored in the library. 
 
 
 Fusion 360 can analyze the effects of forces, vibrations and temperature on the designed elements. More complex designs, consisting of many parts, can be combined with the help of various rigid, rotating and moving connectors in selected planes with range limitations. You can also plan the movement of subsequent elements and see the behavior of the project on simulations. Finally, you can render a model or animation that shows how it works. 
 
 
 The great advantage of Fusion 360 is a well-prepared environment for teamwork. You can store files in the cloud with advanced version control, with the possibility of creating project branches and joining branches. The platform allows you to distribute tasks and communicate with other people from your computer or mobile device. There is also an API that allows you to write your own scripts for Fusion 360. 
 
 
 Preparation for production includes simulation and programming for CNC cutters, CAM path design with preview of the production process and generation of 3D printing files. Of course, you can also prepare technical drawings. 
 
 
 The project browser allows you to open dozens of file formats used in the design industry.
 
 
 You can test Fusion 360 for 30 days after creating an account. Pupils and teachers can use the program for free. They will receive the subscription for three years. Hobbyists and startups earning less than 100,000 dollars a year can also get a subscription for free, but it requires renewing every year.
