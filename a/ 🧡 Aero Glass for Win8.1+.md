> Aero Glass for Win8.1 + is a set of libraries to be injected into the Windows window manager that allows you to add Aero Glass functions to them (transparency of windows). The tool does not modify any system files, and the introduction of this effect to the operating environment is done by rendering it using a native Direct3D device.
