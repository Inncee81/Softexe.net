The program consists of 3 modules, in which we find functions that mainly remove unnecessary components from the hard disk. Systematic use of them will allow the user not only to recover unnecessarily busy space on the computer disk, but also will have a positive effect on the performance of the Windows system and the programs and games installed in it.
 
 Auslogics Windows Slimmer allows you to deletion of obsolete libraries from the WinSxS folder, old versions of Windows archived on the disk (eg after the update of the environment), temporary files of system updates, as well as Windows restore points (omitting the last three). Thanks to the described program, the user will also clean the contents of the system's recycle bin, temporary files folder, logs of various types of applications or copies of data that were stored on a CD / DVD.
 
 Another, noteworthy tool offered by Auslogics Windows Slimmer is the manager of the applications installed on the computer. It displays a list of all available programs and games, including information on how often we use them, allowing you to carry out the operations of their uninstallation (standard and forced).
 
 Attention!
 
 During installation, the wizard offers the user to install additional components. They are not required for the correct operation of the program and we do not recommend installing them.
