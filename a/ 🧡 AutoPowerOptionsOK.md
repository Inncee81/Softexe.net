After launching the AutoPowerOptionsOK program, we will see its main window with the following options: turn off the monitor, put the computer into sleep mode and the automatic power option switch. Individual settings can be activated manually or according to predetermined rules (eg after a specified number of minutes).
 
 As mentioned above, AutoPowerOptionsOK can also change the power mode depending on whether the user is currently using the computer. There are five different settings to choose from that can save you electricity or a laptop battery.
 
 AutoPowerOptionsOK displays a message on the screen before the computer goes into sleep mode (the time of presenting this information can also be defined in the program options). You do not need to worry that the application will temporarily turn off the device, for example, while watching a movie.
