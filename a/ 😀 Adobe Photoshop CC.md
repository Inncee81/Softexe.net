Photoshop gives the user the opportunity to create professional and extremely impressive projects, consisting of an almost unlimited number of layers, masks, graphics in high resolution, neatly combined with each other through a wide range of filters and effects. Photoshop also offers a set of useful tools to improve work with graphics and applications - including Adobe Bridge file browser, Adobe Extension Manager extension manager, Adobe Drive service, etc.The most important changes in the CS6 version
 
 On the list of changes we can find a lot of new features, such as a dark user interface, photo processing mechanisms using the Camera Raw plug-in from the recently released Lightroom 4 and the Content Aware Move tool. In addition, we find here a newly designed framing tool, minor fixes in Minibridge, a gallery of effects imitating lighting, the option "Content-Aware" using the ≈Åatka tool, support for Middle East and North African texts, information-rich cursors for some tools and much more.
 
 The filmmakers will probably be interested in supporting 10-bit monitors, drawing dummies, tool tips and new airbrush tips, while designers are able to attract objects to pixels and apply styles to groups of objects. Photographers will find a gallery blur (depth of field, model and iris), the ability to generate masks "aware" of the presence of faces in the image, and a Dynamic Wide Angle filter that "straightens" objects in the pictures taken with wide-angle lenses. Noteworthy are also significant changes in program performance and automatic saving during work. Filters Liquify and Pixel Bender, and coiling (Warp and Puppet Warp) have gained hardware acceleration and are made using a graphics card.
