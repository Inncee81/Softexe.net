There is no denying that streaming services dominate the contemporary music market, and users can use many of these services, switching between them at any time. However, to avoid these "changes", you can install Autobeat Player, and then enjoy access to songs from YouTube, SoundCloud or local library from one application with a modern, transparent interface.
 
 Autobeat Player offers a number of extremely useful functionalities. It allows you to generate playlists and download covers, easily search for owned songs, and also offers access to car mode. It is also possible to transfer songs to Hi-Fi systems. Noteworthy is also the synchronization of data within the Wi-Fi network.
