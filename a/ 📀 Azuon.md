The program is very simple and intuitive to use. In addition to the basic criteria of flight connections such as departure and arrival locations, number of transfers, checking return flights or time frames, it offers much more interesting options. We find among them the possibility of defining the number of travelers, filtering connections due to the cost of the flight, as well as performing payments with Visa cards.
