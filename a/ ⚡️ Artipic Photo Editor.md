> Artipic Photo Editor is a photo editor, thanks to which we will perform a retouch operation of the selected photo very quickly (eg remove the red-eye effect).

In a situation where we want to edit many files, Artipic Photo Editor allows you to work in batch mode. All you have to do is select the available images or even entire folders, specify the editing rules (eg rotate the image by 90 degrees) and click the button to start the operation. The program offers the function of saving batch mode settings, which you can use later without having to redefine the settings.
 
 Artipic Photo Editor contains various styles (including normal, stylized for the eighties, old card, low resolution, under water), which allow you to change the appearance of a given photo with just one click. Brushes are also available (and the ability to create your own!), Which you can paint on the photos. All effects are entered in real time and do not affect the contents of the source file - you can save them in the form of a new image.
 
 Initially, it may seem that the user interface of the Artipic Photo Editor is overwhelming, but it is only a semblance - individual options are available at your fingertips, and the editors of the photo should be able to cope with less experienced recipients.
 
 Attention!
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
