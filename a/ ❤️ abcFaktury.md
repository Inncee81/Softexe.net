Attention! From January 1, 2018, the obligation to keep electronic VAT records and to submit them as a Uniform Control File (JPK) is introduced. The abcFaktura program is prepared for these changes and allows you to generate JPK-VAT, JPK-FA files.
  
 abcFaktury supports all types of invoices: VAT, proforma, WNT, margin, RR, advances, corrections, advance and purchase invoices, bills, receipts and accounting notes, interest and correcting. We have several templates of invoices to choose from and an editor that allows you to modify them and create your own, it is also possible to put your own logo and watermark on your documents. Invoices can be assigned to a category and stored in a tree.
 For currency invoices, the program collects exchange rates and NBP table information by itself. Invoices can be issued in Polish, English, German, French, Russian and bilingual. Service notes include accountants, dispensation and correction. The program gives the possibility of placing a logo on documents and a watermark. In addition, a verification was introduced in the Central Statistical Office, CEiDG, VIES, including the possibility of installing an active VAT payer module in Poland and the European Union
 
 
 abcFaktury meets the requirements of the RODO, related to the storage and processing of personal data. The contractors in the database can be anonymized for statistical purposes - the data will be deleted from the database allowing identification (company name, NIP, address, e-mail, telephone number, etc.), postal code, postal code, city, district, province and contractor's country . Invoices not older than 5 years will be in the base, as the regulations require. In addition, you can generate a report with information that we have about the contractor. Local SQLite databases can be encrypted using the AES256 algorithm and create additional security measures: forcing the use of appropriately complex passwords and cyclic change of passwords, encryption of all attachments saved in the program and encryption of generated PDF files.
 
 abcInfactura allows you to conveniently handle sales thanks to a special sales window (POS). The program can work with cash registers and bar code readers. There was no possibility to run a database of contractors and gather in them detailed information about customers, including individual price lists, rebates, trade credits and payment dates. Available products and services can be written down in a simple index. All data is automatically secured in backups.
 
 Invoices, orders and warehouse documents can be imported in various supported formats. Export is possible, among others, to accounting programs such as Comarch Optima, Insert (Rachmistrz, Revision), Wapro Fakir, R2KSIÄ˜GA and others. In addition, abcInvoices can use bsxEdi - a document exchange system between companies that also use this program. Encrypted documents are sent using the BinSoft server. When the bsxEdi user downloads his document from the BinSoft server, the document will be deleted. One person who can read and store a document is his recipient.
 
 
 The program is available for free for companies issuing up to 10 documents a month. Without restrictions, it costs only PLN 49 net per year. Program updates and technical support for users are free.
