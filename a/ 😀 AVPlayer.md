The creators of the AVPlayer program apparently assumed that not all people would be able to watch one video material. Therefore, the described tool enables simultaneous launch of many films using the drag-and-drop technique. For each of them a separate mini-media player has been prepared, thanks to which we can freely manage individual images, changing, for example, the aspect ratio, speed of play and volume.
 
 Among the file formats supported by AVPlayer we can find: avi, mp4, wmv, m4v, mkv, mov, mpg, rmvb, vob, flv, mts, ogv, webm, 3gp, dat, divx, h264, m2ts, m2v, mp4v, mpeg, mpeg2, mpeg4, mpg2, qt, rm, ts, xvid, 264, 3g2, 3gp2, 3gpp, and many more.
