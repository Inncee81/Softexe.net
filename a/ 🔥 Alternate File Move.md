> Alternate File Move is a free and quite user-friendly program that can be used both as a "comparison" of two folders, as well as a tool for creating automatic data backup.

The whole magic of this application is to indicate the Master folder, and then select the location for the Slave folder, which will be a mirror image of its "owner". Of course, we can also indicate two folders, which in theory are supposed to have identical content, and the analysis of the program will make sure that it really is. Mostly, however, Alternate File Move can be used as an application to create a perfect backup and its synchronization with the main (Master) directory.
 
 The program offers several options related to synchronization. First of all, we can order the application to automatically copy files to the Slave folder in case new ones appear in the Master, or delete them if they disappear from the Master. We can recommend that copying also be empty directories, disable ignoring the write protection, or decide whether to disable the program or Windows after finishing the task.
