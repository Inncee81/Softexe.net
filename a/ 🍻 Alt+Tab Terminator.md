The shortcut Alt + Tab or Windows + Tab can be selected in the settings as the starting program. After pressing it, we will see a window with thumbnails of program windows that can be operated with the mouse or at the keyboard level. With each window we have the option of closing it, stopping the program or starting another instance.
 
 In the program settings, you can also choose the window size and a compact or looser layout, as well as a dark window theme. The switch can also work in full-screen mode.
