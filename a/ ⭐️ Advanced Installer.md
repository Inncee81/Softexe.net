The program is designed mainly for experienced users or programmers who are looking for a functional tool to create reliable and professional MSI packages. Using the Advanced Installer, you can create fully functional installers for any application equipped with a modern graphic design. 
 
 
 Advanced Installer has a very clear and intuitive user interface, in which we find built-in configuration wizards supporting the creation of simple, complex and more functional MSI packages. In addition, it offers access to ready-made templates that support the creation of installers for the .NET Framework, ASP.NET or Visual Studio and XNA Game packages.
 
 Users can create installers not only for the applications themselves, but also for various updates or other additions to programs (additions to the Microsoft Office, Visual Studio or Adobe office suite). When creating a simple installer, we give its full name and manufacturer's details, set individual options and functions of the installer, and add all files related to the application and entries in the system registry. Next, choose the appropriate MSI package type and fill in the other options related to the user interface and the operating system. 
 
 Attention!
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 10 days.
