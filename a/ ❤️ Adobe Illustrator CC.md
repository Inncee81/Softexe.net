 The advantage of Adobe Illustrator is a fully customizable user interface, as well as the ability to export to SVG and SVG-t graphics. Among the features that Adobe Illustrator CC offers include new brush options for creating variable thickness brushes and precise thickness setting at any point, functions that allow you to intuitively connect, edit and fill shapes directly on the canvas without having to use many additional tools .
