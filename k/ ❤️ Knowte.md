> Knowte is an elegant notebook in which you can create notebooks and save more notes in them. The program resembles OneNote, but it is much simpler and does not synchronize data with the cloud.

The possibilities of formatting the text in Knowte are very poor. In the notes, you can place bulleted lists, links and format the text, but without the option to select fonts. You also can not include images in your notes. 
 
 
 Notes can be searched, printed and exported in RTF or Note format. The program allows you to collect them in notebooks and mark as favorites the more important ones. 
 
 
 In Knowte settings, you can choose the color of the program or allow it to use the color of Windows. In addition, in the settings you can choose how the notes will be displayed and the default text size.
