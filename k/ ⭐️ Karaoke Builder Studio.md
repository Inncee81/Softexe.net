Sometimes it turns out that in various karaoke collections (eg extremely popular Singstarze) we will not find our favorite songs that we would like to sing. In this situation, it is worth using the Karaoke Builder Studio, an application that allows you to prepare your own karaoke songs.
 
 Karaoke Builder Studio is an easy-to-use program. We choose the song, add the text, and then synchronize the words with the music to get the desired effect, by editing the various elements on the way and thereby bringing the whole to perfection. Interestingly, the authors of professional CD + G media use the described tool, which can be purchased even on the Internet.
 
 Individual songs prepared using Karaoke Builder Studio can be played on any device that supports CD + G.
