Koinonein BitTorrent Client contains the most important features that we expect from this kind of program, so we'll add a lot of files with .torrent extension to it, but not only - we can also use the .magnet format, or IPv4 and Ipv6 trackers. The tool supports DHT server, HTTP encryption, SSL support, allows you to create multiple torrents at the same time and offers the ability to work according to the schedule.
 
 Koinonein BitTorrent Client allows you to decide how the application should behave after the download is complete (eg it will cause the computer to shut down or go into sleep mode). It is possible to define the speed of downloading data, pause and stop downloading, delete torrents, create categories if you have a larger number of torrents, set the upload limit, and choose in which order you want to download further files.
 
 The creators of Koinonein BitTorrent Client ensure that it is free of any spyware, but when you run the described tool, you will notice that you will not find any toolbars in it (Koinonein BitTorrent Client will not install them in any other applications).
