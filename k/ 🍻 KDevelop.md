KDevelop allows you to work on projects of any size and has been designed so as not to hinder the work of programmers. The basis of IDE is an advanced editor with a semantic code analysis system, thanks to which the program "understands" the project. Thanks to this, in fully supported languages, you can use refill, advanced navigation and quickly get information about selected fragments. You can conveniently search for functions, jump between the declaration and the variable definition and find further use of symbols (variables, types, etc.). In addition, KDevelop can be used to control the quality of code, review classes and design, verify the operation of solutions and implement ready tools. An interesting fact is the possibility of "rainbow coloring" code - each variable can have its own color.
 
 KDevelop can be expanded with various plugins. By default, the environment works with several version control systems (GitHub, Bazaar, Subversion, CVS, Mercurial and Perforce) and build (CMake, QMake, own Makefile), and also deals with automating building tools such as make and ninja. IDE also integrates with various documentation providers, such as QtHelp. Man pages, CMake help pages and many more.
 
 KDevelop can be adapted to your own feud thanks to the ability to freely change buttons and tools, and the ability to set your own colors and keyboard shortcuts for virtually every environment function. 
 
 
 Attention!
 
 KDevelop does not contain a C / C ++ compiler. You can install it yourself according to the instructions .
