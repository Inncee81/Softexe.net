Kakao Talk is a very easy to use, but at the same time quite extensive and free instant messenger. The version for personal computers allows you to synchronize data with editing to mobile devices.

In addition to the standard possibility of exchanging private messages in two people, Kakao Talk also allows group chat with an unlimited number of users from around the world. You can enter text as well as send documents, photos, contact information, voice memos or locations. Each chat can be password protected so that unauthorized users can not gain access to our conversations.
 
 Cocoa Talk also allows you to get voice calls and video calls from users around the world completely for free (around the clock). The conversation can be made more attractive using built-in voice and video filters.
 
 Importantly, Kakao Talk is great for entertainment purposes, but the communicator can be successfully installed on company computers. The group chat window can resemble a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet whose appearance (font type and text size) can be customized to suit your needs.
