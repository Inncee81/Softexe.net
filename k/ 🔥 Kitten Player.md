Using this application should not cause any problems to anyone. Kitten Player allows you to search for files and display results in the form of thumbnails (like on YouTube), download selected songs to your computer's hard drive, and also allow you to add your own songs to the playlist. It is worth noting that when deciding to download the material, we choose whether we want to download it, or immediately recreate or convert from M4A (the default application format) to MP3.
 
 Kitten Player also has the function of importing a selected playlist directly from YouTube, which we will be able to naturally run through the described tool. Interestingly, individual playlists are available in the form of tabs, which makes it easy to switch between them.
