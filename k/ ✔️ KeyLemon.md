After installing the KeyLemon application, we do not have to use the standard method of logging in to the operating system or to social networking sites. All you need to do is to properly set up the program with the connected camera. Then, each time you start your computer, you can log in without entering any login data, only looking into the lens of the active camera. 
 
 
 Thanks to the built-in Face Recognition technology, the program provides full security when logging into the system and offers access only to authorized users. KeyLemon recognizes our face without any problems and what's most important can be very helpful and effective when logging in to social networks such as Facebook or Twitter. 
 
 Attention!
  The KeyLemon program is available in a trial version and has a limited number of available functions.
