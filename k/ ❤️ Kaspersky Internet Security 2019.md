It is based on the Kaspersky Anti-Virus antivirus program. It is also equipped with a personal firewall. Laptop users can define separate firewall modes for different networks - the Internet, local area network and trusted network. The program also allows you to work in "stealth mode", in which the user's computer will be completely invisible on the network. Antispam filter is supervised above the mail.
 
 Kaspersky Internet Security has also been equipped with a new parental control module. Thanks to the system of linguistic analysis and the possibility of using black lists, this module allows parents to control the activities of their children on the Web. Kaspersky Internet Security also has a feature that allows you to protect confidential user data (e-mail addresses, passwords, credit card information, etc.) from theft.
 
  Attention!
 The trial version allows you to use the program for a period of 30 days.
