> Backup and Sync (Google Backup and Sync) is a program for synchronizing data from Google Drive and Photo Services, which is a connection and direct successor of separate Drive and Photo clients. It enables automatic data transfer between a computer and a virtual disk in the cloud to provide additional data security.

The application should not be a surprise to existing users of previous programs from Google. The options available in the settings are the same here, but their layout has been slightly changed, adding the division into tabs, and the main advantage of the program is simply to simplify the service by combining both services together.
 
 Among the settings we can find, among others, the possibility of indicating the exact path of data recording, selecting folders for synchronization, or deciding that the transmitted photos will also be automatically transferred to Google Photos. 
 
 The choice of the quality in which they are to be transmitted is available: Google offers its own algorithms for limiting file sizes (at the expense of quality), but as a result, unlimited free space. An alternative is to use lossless transmission, but then the photos count down the disk space available in our package.
