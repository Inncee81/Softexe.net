The operation of the mentioned malware is very simple - it is designed to effectively prevent the user from working with the computer on a daily basis. This limitation is most often taken off when the victim decides to pay the "ransom" for the creator of the pest. Xorist can successfully encrypt random data on the disk - these can be valuable documents, as well as system files, effectively limiting the functionality of Windows. The infection of this ransomware can be confirmed by the presence of the file 'CryptLogFile.txt' in the Windows folder or files 'Read Me: how to decrypt files' and 'Прочти Меня - как расшифровать файлы' located on the system volume.
 
 Kaspersky XoristDecryptor is an extremely useful tool for people who have become victims of Rakhni. The program, after launching, scans the contents of hard disks for encrypted data, and then allows you to decrypt them, and thus access to lost data and restore Windows to a normal state.
 
 It is worth noting that Kaspersky XoristDecryptor will not protect us against infection, but only will unlock previously encrypted files. In addition to the Trojan horse, the tool also allows you to decrypt data blocked by such pests as Cryit and Vandev.
