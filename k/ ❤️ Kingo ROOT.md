The program is very easy to use and does not require any specialized knowledge to successfully perform the rooting process. It is a very good solution for less experienced smartphone users and enables almost automatic root-up of the device. All you need to do is activate the USB debugging mode on your smartphone, connect it to your computer via a USB cable, and Kingo ROOT will automatically install all the necessary drivers and suggest to rooting the device.
 
 In the event of a failure, Kingo ROOT will display the option of re-attempting to root. There was also a 'Remove Root' function, which allows you to quickly and efficiently restore the device to the default settings.
