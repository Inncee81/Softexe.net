KaliBronek is a tool for calibrating raster in a CAD environment, which in addition to the calibration itself also allows convenient editing and management of raster images.

The program uses a unique way of specifying customization points. It consists in plotting in CAD the usual lines connecting points on the raster with the target points in the drawing. This gives a lot of control over the calibration process and makes it easy to edit adjustment points. In addition, the entire process can be significantly accelerated in the case of maps containing a cross-mesh, thanks to a special tool for "quick calibration on the grid".
 
 Rasters can be calibrated using many transformation models: by similarity, by affinity, affine, two-line, polynomial 2 and 3 degree. A pioneering solution that allows you to calibrate any, even very deformed raster, is the possibility to apply Hausbrandt corrections to each of these transformation methods.
 
 The program has been equipped with a number of editing tools: overpainting (clearing) the indicated area, inversion, trimming, sticking, denoising and even removing the trace after clipping to the sub-frame. An interesting solution is the ability to edit the raster fragment in the selected external editor.
 
 KaliBronek enables many wholesale operations on raster files connected to a CAD drawing: saving georeferencing, zooming to a raster group, changing the color and transparency of rasters in a CAD drawing, file format conversions, compression, color palettes and many others.
 
 The tool cooperates with CAD MicroStation platforms (95, SE, v7 / J, v8, v8 2004 Edition, XM, v8i, Connect Edition and derived versions: PowerDraft, PowerMap, GeoOutlook, Redline, Navigator), AutoCAD (from 2000 to 2016, AutoCAD LT - only with LT Extender or Cadsta Max), IntelliCAD and derivatives (from version 6, including: BricsCAD, ZwCAD +, GStarCAD, progeCAD and others), DesignCAD (from version 12) and CorelDRAW / Corel DESIGNER (from version 12) .
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days. In addition to the calibrated raster, "Calibronek demo version" is added.
