After launching Karaoke 5 on the screen we will see various panels that can be freely moved and configured to customize the appearance of the program to your preferences. Thus, it is possible not only to display the list of songs, lyrics of a given song (naturally fully synchronized with the sound), but also to mix individual pieces and search for subsequent hits on the Internet.
 
 Among the supported audio files we can find: K5, MIDI, KAR, KFN, MP4, WMA, MP3 + CDG, WMA and CD + G. Karaoke 5 also supports the following video file formats: MP4 and FLV. Both of them will be easily launched using the built-in player. We can not only turn on individual songs, but also add them to your playlist.
