The program provides protection against various types of viruses (polymorphic and self-encrypting, scripting, macro viruses), and thanks to heuristic analysis, the program monitors, limits and blocks suspicious activities performed by applications. Three basic methods are used to detect threats: signature-based, proactive and heuristic. The program is also equipped with a module that allows detecting and blocking network attacks.
 
 The MailChecker module used in the program, which acts as an anti-spam filter, enables cooperation with all the most popular e-mail clients working on the basis of SMTP and POP3.
 
  Attention!
 The trial version allows you to use the program for a period of 30 days.
