KeyLock is a small tool that allows you to lock your computer if the selected media is removed from it - usually external USB storage media is the carrier.

Thanks to blocking the computer in the absence of a plugged-in flash drive (or other pre-defined drive), we can secure your workstation against unauthorized access, knowing that no unauthorized person will be able to access the computer and its data. For such a small application, KeyLock has a decent number of additional options, allowing to set not only the "unlocking disk" and passwords, but also other functions.
 
 Among these additional options, it is nice to see options for changing the color and style of the graphical login screen, or quite a lot of options for setting energy efficiency, which is especially valuable for users who want to protect laptops. At any time, we can also export or import settings, or reset the lock.
