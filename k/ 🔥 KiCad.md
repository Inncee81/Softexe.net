The software is created and developed by the French scientist Jean-Pierre Charrasa on an open source basis. It is based on the wxWidgets library, thanks to which it can be launched on Windows, Linux, Mac OS, Solaris or FreeBSD systems. It consists of 5 powerful tools - schematic editor (eeschema), printed circuit board editor (pcbnew), Gerber file viewer (gerbview), application for assigning electronic components housings (cvpcb) and a program for creating graphics elements on boards (bitmap2component) . They are all managed from the level of the main component, the kicad component.
 
 All projects prepared using the KiCad package can be easily exported to files in the Postscript, SVG, Gerber RS274D / X, HPGL, DXF and Excellon formats.
