With KLS Backup 2015, we can back up all data, including, of course, separate files, as well as entire folders, databases (Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL) or messages in the mailbox (Outlook, Thunderbird), or other, various applications everyday use (in the cloud or on the FTP server). Files compressed using the described program can also be archived to popular formats: Zip or 7z.
 
 KLS Backup 2015 also offers an advanced file search system that allows you to find and restore any backup. The entire operation, including searching, takes only a few seconds. However, remember to properly name the catalogs and files, so that there would be no trouble finding them. 
 
 Interestingly, a schedule is also available in the KLS Backup 2015 program. Therefore, we can determine when exactly the backup operation should be performed. It may be particularly useful for administrators (the tool supports not only home versions of "windows", starting from Windows XP, but also from Windows Server since 2003).
 
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
