Kryptos program user can secure his data using a symmetric Rijndael block cipher using 128, 192 or 256-bit AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) keys. TripleDES encryption is also available, which processes each block of data three times with the DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm.
 
 To perform a data security operation using the Kryptos tool, simply indicate the appropriate document, multimedia file or any other data (even the entire folder), then specify the output folder, enter the password and confirm it in a separate window.
