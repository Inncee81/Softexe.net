The described program can copy data from one location to another - source folders can be located within the computer, as well as any PC in the local network. The features offered by Karen's Replicator include generating backups at given intervals, copying only those data that have changed, deleting data from the destination, if they were removed from the source, excluding selected files from backup and dates in which backups will not be performed.
 
 The application is not available in the Polish language version, but its support is so intuitive that it should not cause problems even to less experienced users.
