Kdenlive is a non-linear, extensive video editing program that uses the FFmpeg library as a base, thus without the need to convert it supports most popular audio and video formats. The program is developed on the basis of open sources.

The application interface simultaneously displays many elements, including a preview, timeline with support for multiple video and audio tracks, a list of effects and transitions along with settings, as well as available in the multimedia project. The layout and width of individual windows can be individually adapted to your needs. Interestingly, we will also find a dozen or so color themes.
 
 There are a lot of effects and transitions, and each of them can be additionally configured with parameters. The application also includes audio level charts, histograms and powerful tools to create interesting video clips, including options to add titles with full control of their appearance (including editing of shadows, colors and behavior).
 
 Attention!
 For the operation of the program it is necessary to self-install the elements of the FFmpeg package in the following way:
 
 
 The Kdenlive package should be downloaded and unpacked, and then the same should be done with the FFmpeg package   in the 64-bit Shared version (in our database you will find it in the All versions menu ),
 Go to the FFmpeg directory and locate the subfolder \binand then copy the contents to the main folder with Kdenlive files,
 The last step is to copy the whole directory presetsfrom FFmpeg to the main Kdenlive folder.
