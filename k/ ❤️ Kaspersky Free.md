Computer scan can take place in several ways and it is possible to create its schedule. The application interface is easy to use and despite the fact that the program is free - it does not contain advertising. From the main menu level, you can run a scan and update the database. Automatic updates, quarantining and scanning of external storage media are also available. 
 
 During operation, the program provides data to the manufacturer's servers, supporting machine learning that takes care of detecting threats (also in paid services of the company). The manufacturer informs that it is worth investing in a paid version of the application to fully protect your computer. Free Kaspersky Free is supposed to be good in what it was created for. It offers perhaps less features than the competition, but all are refined.
