Kickresume is an add-on to Google Chrome web browser, which can be an interesting proposition for users looking for a job. The tool allows you to quickly create your own CV and share it with potential employers.

The program is available in the free version and Premium version, and as you can easily guess, the free edition of Kickresume offers much less functionality. Nevertheless, it contains several templates to choose from so that ready-made projects can be quickly completed with the necessary personal data, information about your education path and professional experience and skills.
 
 Kickresume in the Premium version contains additional categories that we can place in the resume and allows you to customize the font and colors in the document. We have to check the grammar rules on our own regardless of the release, although the application's manufacturer allows you to use the language validation service, the order of words and, however, the readability (each document is corrected individually).
 
 Kickresume offers the option of saving your CV to a PDF file, which we can send by e-mail or print. The program also generates a link to the website where our document is located, so we can send it to the company also in this form.
