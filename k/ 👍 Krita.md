Krita is free software and distributed under the GNU General Public License. The application has been designed not only as a painting tool, but also for modifying digital photos. Krita has a huge collection of various tools and functions, and also offers a convenient and clear user interface. In this way, we can be a fair competition even for the most popular raster graphic editors, although the main goal of its creators is to compete with Corel Painter. 
 
 
 
 In addition to the basic painting tools, we also get access to a more complex set that allows you to manipulate the canvas, simulate the drying of paint or drawing with a brush with ink and oil paints. Krita supports the most popular graphic formats (BMP, JPEG, PNG, RAW, TIFF), allows you to work on layers and create masks and gradients, allows you to work with vector elements, like curves, and contains a lot of useful sets of filters, with the help of which we lighten or reverse image or sharpen and add various effects to improve the quality of our work.  
 
 
 Krita also offers access to advanced scaling and transformation tools, complex brush engines and selection of the right color and colors. In addition, it modifies the metadata in graphic files, supports graphic tablets and allows you to record macros. It quickly loads graphics files into the editor and supports the latest multi-core processors.
