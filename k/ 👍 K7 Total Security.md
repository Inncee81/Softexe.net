The program is addressed only to home users who would like to protect information shared on the Internet (eg credit card number provided during online transactions) and valuable files (eg confidential documents sent to the company). K7 Total Security scans our HDD in real time through the use of technology "in the cloud", thanks to which the database always remains current.
 
 The tool also protects your hard drive against the threats contained in e-mail attachments, and can also detect spam by using the Bayes filter. K7 Total Security also scans files placed in USB memory (eg pendrive), where infected files may also appear. This means that the program contains a lot of different functions, but it does not overload the computer's resources, so it can run smoothly in the background without affecting the performance of other applications.
 
 K7 Total Security allows you to use the parental control function to protect younger Internet users from accessing inappropriate content. We can limit children's ability to use the web by setting the hours in which they can browse their favorite websites. This option also allows you to check the list of games and programs launched by younger users.
 
 Importantly, K7 Total Security not only takes care of security, but also user's comfort, as it contains numerous tools to optimize the operation of the Windows operating system. Noteworthy is an additional option to delete data without the possibility of restoring them (in this way it is worth to get rid of confidential data so that they do not fall into the hands of third parties).
