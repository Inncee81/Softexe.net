K-Meleon is a fast, light and fully customizable browser on the Gecko engine, which is used in the popular Mozilla Firefox. This web browser can be a good alternative not only to Firefox, but also to other browsers, offering minimal use of system resources, protected browsing and an additional set of useful tools.

By default, this browser uses an anonymous search engine DuckDuckGo, but if you wish, you can replace it with a more preferred one. Of course, work with several tabs, a list of favorites is supported, several bookmark systems are implemented (from Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer and Opera), there is mouse gesture control, a translator is built in, it is possible to save sessions, connect macros, control panel is configured, and there are other integral attributes of browsers.

But special attention is paid to safety. By default, you are already protected from the influence of malware and ActiveX controls. Separately rendered are the control buttons for cookies, Java, image blockers and pop-up windows, clearing the cache, disabling Flash. All this allows you to fully control network privacy and maintain confidentiality of personal data.

If you have an old and configurationally weak computer, then K-Meleon browser will be an excellent solution to the problem of high-quality and fast surfing on the Internet, because of all modern browsers, it uses the least amount of RAM. So try this web browser in action, setting it up "for yourself" and feeling all the speed of your work on the web.
