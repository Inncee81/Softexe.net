Thanks to this program, we can capture the image from a webcam, TV tuner or other video devices, and then make it available in other applications that allow you to edit registered materials. KVYcam allows you to capture video clips (including, for example, user activity on the Windows operating system desktop) and transfer them to other applications.
 
 KVYcam offers the possibility of working in PiP (picture-in-picture) mode with two image sources, allows you to watch movies in full screen, allows you to make screenshots and includes the option to change the parameters of the connected camera.
