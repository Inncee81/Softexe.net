Performing data encryption operations is limited to selecting a file (eg personal information, commercial data, credit card numbers, tax returns, photos, videos) that we want to encrypt and click on the encryption icon. In addition, there is also the possibility of securely sharing encrypted files between your computer, iPhone and iCloud, as well as using encryption and file sharing via Google Drive, Dropbox and OneDrive.
 
 Kruptos 2 Professional uses 256-bit encryption, so we can secure the files in such a way that unauthorized persons can not access them (password protection). You can also allow them only to preview the document without the possibility of making changes to the text. Encrypted files can be permanently deleted at any time (they will not be restored by specialized data recovery tools).
 
 Interestingly, Kruptos 2 Professional also prevents data theft. When the device on which the encrypted files are located, it will go into the hands of the thief, files will be blocked.
