At KD Max, you can use the ready database of facilities and build any box furniture and built-in wardrobes. The designer has the freedom to create shapes and sizes of furniture, whereby the program can automatically insert countertops, pedestals and slats, as well as automatically change all the fronts and handles in the design. During the design, the program detects collisions and allows automatic attraction of the elements. 
 
 
 KD Max has the ability to work with the cabinet module and import external materials - 3DS, DWG, DXF and SKP models, as well as textures. The program continues to access dozens of libraries of ready-made models. In addition, you can create photorealistic renders of furniture, panoramic visualizations of rooms, layouts and documentation. 
 
 
 Before downloading the program, you can choose whether it will be used by the individual customer for the design of a private kitchen or by the company before buying. KD Max requires a graphics card compatible with OpenGL and at least 512 MB RAM (1 GB is recommended). The trial version of the program works for 30 days. 
 
 
 We will also get links to textbooks that will help you learn to model and create visualizations to the e-mail address provided when downloading, in addition to the link to download the program.
