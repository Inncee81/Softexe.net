Thanks to the plugin, it is possible to automatically remember the data used to log on to various types of websites and automatically login to them during the next visit. All passwords are stored securely on the local computer disk in an encrypted database, which can be accessed by entering the password.
 
 KeeFox is based on another popular tool for securely storing passwords - KeePass, which is required for proper operation of the extension.
