ksara Invoices allow you to issue VAT invoices, VAT MP, VAT RR, proforma invoices, reverse invoices, invoices and final invoices, with a margin, as well as duplicates and correcting documents. You can also issue currency invoices with the value of VAT in PLN and bills and freely select the numbering system. There was a sales and payment record, so you can find outstanding contractors. The program supports currencies: PLN, EUR, USD, AUD, CAD, CHF, GBP, JPY and RUB. Product prices can be given net and gross. Each seller can have several bank accounts assigned.
 
 The program allows you to generate document statements and preview files prepared for printing. Many activities can be carried out automatically. Invoices can also be sent by email and put a QR code for mobile payments on them and a separate company logo for each of the sellers. The Book invoice program issues documents adjusted to changes from January 1, 2014 and has the option of generating a Uniform Control File (JPK).
 
 
 The demo version of the program does not allow you to print invoices. You can ask the manufacturer for a time license to test all the functions of the program.
