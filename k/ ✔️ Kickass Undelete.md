The program is addressed to people who accidentally deleted necessary documents, video materials, sound files or any other data. Kickass Undelete supports FAT and NTFS file systems, allowing you to recover data not only from your PC's hard drive, but also from other media (flash drives, SD cards, etc.).
 
 Using Kickass Undelete is relatively simple, because after launching the tool, just select the appropriate partition or data carrier, and then click the huge (huge!) Button "scan" to find the deleted files (we can freely filter them to find data faster we would like to recover). 
 
 The manufacturer claims that Kickass Undeleted best if we perform a file recovery operation as soon as possible after deletion, as new data stored on the media may overwrite those that were accidentally deleted. This can lead to a situation where data recovery will be impossible.
