The user can create his own library of electronic books, sort them and browse by several categories: most read, and by title and by author's name. When reading a selected item, you can use the menu to move to the beginning of the book, view the cover, as well as the table of contents. The program automatically remembers the place where we stopped reading, so we do not have to worry that after opening it again we will have to search the page we last ended up with.
 
 What's more, the application is synchronized with the PC version, as well as iPhone and BlackBerry. We can therefore use the same title database on different devices. We can add notes to read books.
