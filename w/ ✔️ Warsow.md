# ![](https://cdn.softexe.net/static/icon/win.gif) Warsow 2.1.2 - Free Download

> Warsow is a completely free game from the FPS category based on the 3D Engine Qfusion engine (modification of the Quake 2 engine). Thanks to this position, just like in the case of other FPS's, you can check your reflexes, the ability to use the mouse and keyboard simultaneously, as well as your own "battle predispositions" :-).

Warsow is very well polished in terms of configuration. We start the whole game by choosing the profile and model of the character (including its colors), then we check the settings of the mouse and the whole, rich keyboard. In addition, wanting to easily use the chat we have the opportunity to edit a number of shortcuts to ready-made statements. An additional advantage of the game is the full configurability of graphics and sound
 
 A lot of weapons, dynamic action and decent graphics makes Warsow introduce the player in the right, characteristic atmosphere for this type of games. There are two game modes, in singleplayer the player can face bots, and in online mode with real opponents, which usually provides more excitement and entertainment. Anyone can put up their server or connect to an existing one and start playing.
