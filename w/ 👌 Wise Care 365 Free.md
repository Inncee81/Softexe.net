Wise Care 365 Free cleans, defragments and optimizes the system registry, and also completely deletes private user data to prevent later retrieval by other specialized tools. In addition, it increases the stability and accelerates the launch of the operating system. We also find in it special modules for cleaning the hard disk of unused and unnecessary files and any traces of user activity (history of websites viewed, recently opened documents, etc.). Wise Care 365 Free defragments all created system partitions and manages the operational memory.
 
 In addition, the program has been equipped with an extremely useful tool for managing and controlling all applications and services run with the operating system. Any unnecessary process can be easily deactivated, thanks to which we will accelerate the launch of the entire computer.
 
 The free version of the program has been deprived of the automatic update module in the background and management of elements in the context menu of the Explorer. In addition, Wise Care 365 Free offers a smaller selection of interface skins and does not have several tools responsible for removing traces left during use of the computer. Wise Care 365 Free is a fully functional tool for non-commercial use.
