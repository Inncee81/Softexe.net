> Wire is a multiplatform communicator, which owes its popularity to the fact that it was created in cooperation with programmers working previously on Skype. The program is available on various platforms, and the most distinguished is its well-developed interface.

After registering in the communicator and verifying your identity by email, the user can synchronize their contact list with the Gmail mailbox. The main application screen is divided into two parts: the list of contacts is displayed on the left, and the conversation itself on the right. The program looks very elegant, the interface runs smoothly and without any problems. This combination will be appreciated, for example, during presentations or conferences.
 
 Wire functionality can be considered satisfactory. The program allows text and voice communication. In the first case, it is also possible to conduct a group conversation in which up to 128 users can take part. It is possible to send images in a convenient and effective way, as well as links to such websites as YouTube or Spotify, which will be automatically embedded in the conversation view and can be played there without having to launch the browser. For many, an important advantage may be the fact that the content of conversations carried out with the help of Wire is encrypted.
