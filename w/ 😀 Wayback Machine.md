```sh
Wayback Machine is an add-on to Firefox, which if you encounter a 404 error on the Web, allows you to display a copy of the page from the archive, although the condition is of course its availability.
```
[![Wayback Machine](https:https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.7X6hehT3FufW_2QSOQgjswHaGm&pid=Api)](https://softexe.net/win/internet/browser-add-ons/wayback-machine:pRhbd.html)

This add-on is a direct continuation of the No More 404s project , which was previously tested for Firefox as part of the Test Pilot program. When browsing the Internet and encountering a malfunction, the add-on automatically offers to load a copy of the site instead of a blank page.
 
 The extension will work properly in Firefox 57, which will support only WebExtensions.
