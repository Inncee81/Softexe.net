World of Tanks gives a unique opportunity to empathize with the role of the commander of the armored combat vehicle. However, in order to be able to direct a real monster, we first have to pass an exam of our skills on one of four available light tanks: American, French, German or Soviet. In the initial phase of the game we can experience a slight frustration resulting from the small combat capabilities of our vehicle, but as time passes and with the experience gained, we can gradually change this state of affairs mainly by buying upgrades intended for our model. Systematically and consistently we modernize the engine, chassis, turret and radio. Unfortunately, many amenities remain in terms of micropayments, but well ...
 
 The system of improving and increasing our combat efficiency is also the so-called technological tree, thanks to which we can activate next vehicles from the middle class, heavy class, destroyers or self-propelled guns with the aid of points gained during the fights. We can also modify them accordingly. The game also has a crew promotion system. The higher its level of experience, resulting either from the training system or from the number of skirmishes fought, the more rational behavior on the battlefield. One-time use also includes items such as first aid kits, repair kits or special fuel additives that increase engine power.
 
 World of Tanks offers some interesting game modes. The most popular is Random Play, where players are divided into two fifteen-person teams and then assigned to a random room. The team that wins the enemy base or eliminates all opponents from the game wins. We can still choose the Clan War, the Meeting Battle (we can invite friends), Garage or Escort mode.
 
 World of Tanks is a great network battle tank simulator with a strong strategic foundation and an extensive system of improvements and advancements. It contains a lot of historical aspects, mainly related to the mechanics and the exact specifics of combat equipment, which makes the game show the high realism of the battles carried out. In addition, the ability to compete in clans with other players, the systematic expansion of their own arsenal and promotions make the game can be drawn for a very long time.
