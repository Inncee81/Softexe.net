WeatherMate is a small and fully free application whose task is to display weather information in the location indicated by the user.

The program allows you to add several different locations presented in separate tabs and allows you to quickly switch between them. The database offered by WeatherMate contains tens of thousands of places from around the world, so there should be no problem finding cities or towns. Interestingly, thanks to this tool, we will also be notified about unfavorable weather conditions in your area.
 
 WeatherMate appears by default on the top of the desktop, and the program window automatically hides when we do not use it. These settings, however, can be freely modified using a number of options, thanks to which we will change the size and location of the main application window, how to display weather information (basic or detailed) and many more.
