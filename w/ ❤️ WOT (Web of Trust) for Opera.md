The plugin is an interesting addition to the standard security software. It is based on a huge database of ratings and website reputation, which is created by a multi-million users group. WOT displays information about the reputation of a given website just after opening it in the browser. All alerts are available from the icon of this extension, which is displayed in the browser window. In addition to the ratings of other users, we can also submit your notes in two categories - Trust and Safety for children.
 
 The extension can also display colored icons with reputation in search results, social networks or e-mail messages. It helps protect the user from scams, malware, dishonest online stores, unsafe links and many other threats. Importantly, after switching to the suspicious website, WOT displays a warning window that gives you the option of continuing your stay on a given website or returning to a safe place.
