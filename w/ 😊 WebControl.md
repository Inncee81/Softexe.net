The tool works independently of the browser and the Internet access environment. The great advantage of the WebControl program is the frequently updated database of dangerous websites, which can be freely modified and expanded to include your own items. The application also allows you to block online games and access to the most popular messengers and chat rooms: GaduGadu, Google Talk, Skype, ICQ, and Oxygen. The user can also block any program installed on the computer.
 
 The possibilities of the program do not end there. WebControl has also been equipped with a module limiting access to the Internet in selected time intervals and a system blocking access to email: Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo !, Onet, WP, Interia, o2, and Gazeta. In addition, the application offers the function of generating screenshots with a specific frequency, a log of running processes in the system, as well as blocking disc burning and data storage on USB drives.
