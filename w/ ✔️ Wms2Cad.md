The program allows you to connect to any WMS site if the website owner has shared the public address of the service. Knowing the address of the WMS service, you can define the connection with the service yourself using a special wizard. Less experienced users can use ready-made connection definitions, among which they can choose from several dozen predefined connections for various mapping services, including the most popular topographic maps and orthophotomaps from the Geoportal service as well as maps from the Open Street Map service.
 
 Wms2Cad cooperates with such CAD software as AutoCAD (from 2000 to the latest version), AutoCAD LT (only with LT Extender or CadstaMax software), MicroStation (from version 8.1: v8 2004 EDITION, XM, v8i, Connect Edition and related versions: PowerDraft, PowerMap, PowerSurvey, Redline) and IntelliCAD (from 2000 to the newest, including progeCAD, GstarCAD, ZwCAD, BricsCad and others).
 
 The tool offers the possibility of raster calibration in BMP, TIFF, JPEG, PCX, PNG, GIF, etc. formats.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days and download a maximum of 1,000 tiles.
