For fans of the World War Z movie and more
 
 In the case of discussing the game World War Z association with a movie of the same title are the most in place, but the work of the studio Saber Interactive is not a faithful adaptation of the cinema image. After all, we get here a story with action set in three cities (New York, Moscow and Jerusalem) controlled by undead, which we explore, trying to survive the next days.
 
 Different characters to choose from
 
 World War Z allows you to play one of several unique heroes (shooter, demolition man, a doctor, a doctor, a handyman and an exterminator), who differ from each other with both available equipment and skills, and thus have completely different tasks to made on the battlefield. Therefore, during the cooperation game you have to cooperate with other players to use the unique abilities of individual team members at the right moments.
 
 It should be noted that World War Z provides really dynamic clashes, because sometimes we can see even hundreds of infected people on the screen.
