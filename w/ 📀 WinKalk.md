The program has been equipped with more than 30 different types of computational functions, allowing to perform typical tasks such as tachymetric conversion, offsets, indentation, fields, data for elevation, and more sophisticated like polygon, free stands, plot design for a given surface, busol sequences. The modules integrated with WinKalek enable designing routes (arcs, clothoid) and altitude studies (leveling, calculating the earth's mass volume).
 
 WinKalk has tools for visually previewing calculated geodetic structures, their enlargement and editing. Of course, the created projects can be printed. Importantly, the program offers direct data transmission from recorders and total stations. The current edition supports over 20 types of recorders that are available on the Polish market.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
