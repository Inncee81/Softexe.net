To use the messenger, you must have an active company account in the service. Messenger is available for free, but to use it, it is necessary to purchase a license for the company from the selected offer. After logging in, users can create channels and conduct conversations in closed and open groups, exchange files, use the freehand drawing board and plan group or one-person meetings. There are many references (@) and many other features that facilitate communication in the team. In the working areas, you can add integration with bots and change notification settings. 
 
 
 During voice and video calls, the Webex Teams client allows you to share your desktop as a whole or a single window, so you can very conveniently conduct presentations. You can join the conversation with the help of the Webex Teams client, from the browser level, if we receive the appropriate link, by phone or from Cisco devices. The moderator leading the meeting can accept people from outside and silence selected users. 
 
 
 The conversation can be transferred to another mobile device, another computer or the Cisco VoIP system at any time. Call history and all messages are available and can be searched. In addition, you can schedule meetings in the calendar.
