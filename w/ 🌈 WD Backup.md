To save yourself from the loss of valuable files, it is worth making a backup. Backup can apply to selected documents, but nothing prevents you from securing the whole Windows operating system and restoring it to operation when needed (eg when the hard disk refuses to be obeyed). The mirror image of the computer also allows you to save all files (including the system and installed programs).
 
 WD Backup is not a difficult to use program, which means that less experienced users will also be able to manage the data backup. The backup can be made "manually" at any time or it can be prepared regularly in an automatic manner in accordance with a predetermined schedule.
