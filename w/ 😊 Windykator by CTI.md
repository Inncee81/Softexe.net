The application is closely related to the CDN Optima software liabilities database, from which it obtains detailed information about upcoming payments or payments whose delivery deadline has already passed. After proper configuration, the Debt Collection by CTI allows fully automated sending of notifications and reminders via e-mail or SMS, without the need for any user service. This type of solution saves time and also reduces the costs that an enterprise would have to bear in connection with the commencement of debt collection activities.
 
 The functions offered by Vindicator by CTI allow the user not to automate the process of notifying the debtors about payments, which also determine the number of days before / after the date they are to be sent, declare the start time of sending, assign e-mail templates and SMS to the contractors, send notifications aggregate etc. The program also gives the possibility of sending aggregate messages in the form of a newsletter (eg with promotions, new offers or holiday greetings) and notifications about the account balance and analyzing repayment of receivables using financial liquidity indicators. Attention!
 The demo version of the program has functional limitations, including no possibility to send notifications via text messages.
