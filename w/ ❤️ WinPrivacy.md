WinPrivacy is a program that helps to protect our privacy on the Internet by analyzing in real time all programs that access the network - even if they do not do it in an open manner, connecting in the background.

With this application, the user has the ability to monitor all (and absolutely all) of the programs, thereby being able to see what applications send or download information from the network all the time and how many connections they open. If you suspect that a given program is a virus or other dangerous software, you have the option of blocking access to the Internet for a suspicious application. The program also collects statistics that allow you to view, among others, the number of programs that have gained access to the network and how many connection attempts have been blocked.
 
 WinPrivacy presents all information in the form of a simple list containing the name of the application, its full path, the number of active connections and the time of the first and last connection. This tool also allows you to block Flash cookies, thanks to which we can remove them completely from your computer.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version does not have the ability to block programs that connect to the network.
