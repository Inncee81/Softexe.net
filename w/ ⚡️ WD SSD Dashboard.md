The program allows us to view data about the device in SMART technology, as well as diagnostics of the data carrier and prediction of its possible failure. It offers functions of firmware update, permanent deletion of data (eg in case of SSD disk sales), as well as access to many detailed information - including capacity, created volumes, temperature, interface speed, and expected lifetime.
 
 Among the options responsible for disk performance, we find performance measurement - transfer speed (MB / sec (megabytes per second) and IOPS transfer (number of I / O operations per second)). From the WD SSD Dashboard level, it is possible to activate the TRIM function in Windows, which frees memory on the SSD that was used by deleted files.
