The principle of the program does not differ in any way from the solutions offered by competitive tools. After starting Wise Driver Care, it analyzes the hardware installed in the computer, then checks the versions of installed drivers and compares them with the counterparts in its database. The tool supports the majority of components assembled in the computer and connected to it via various ports. Lisa of supported components includes all kinds of chipsets and controllers, graphics and sound cards, network chips, bluetooth modules, touchpads and many more. 
 
 Wise Driver Care allows you to update previously installed drivers, as well as install missing components such as unrecognized hardware. In addition, it also offers the option of conveniently uninstalling drivers and backing them up to a local computer drive. There was also an interesting function of solving hardware problems, eg sound systems or network interfaces.
