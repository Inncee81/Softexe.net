From the main Wondershare Recoverit window, we can choose one of eight variants corresponding to our needs. It is possible to recover deleted files, recycle bin contents, data from a formatted hard disk, recover lost partition, restore data from external devices, recover files after a virus attack, or an operating system failure. If we do not know exactly which option to choose, we can choose a general scan.
 
 Using the Wondershare Recoverit program is based on three simple steps. We choose one of the many available work modes described above, click the button responsible for scanning and wait for the effects of the described tool, selecting from the list the files that we want to restore.
