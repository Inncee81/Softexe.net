This desktop application is targeted at users of Acer, Alcatel, BLU, HTC (One M8 and 8X), LG, Lumia, NEO, UniStrong, VAIO and Yezz phones, as well as HP devices. However, before we decide to use the Windows Device Recovery Tool, we must try to restart or reset the phone. If these steps do not solve our problem, there is nothing else we can do to install the described tool.
 
 However, one should bear in mind that the Windows Device Recovery Tool not only installs a new version of Windows in the mobile version, but also removes all data from the user's phone, so it is extremely important to back up the history of calls, messages, applications, games and multimedia stored in the memory of the mobile device.
