With WinAutomation, we can easily record and play the press of individual keys on the keyboard or mouse clicks while running any program. Thanks to this, we do not have to manually perform the same tasks, but we can run the registered macros and automate repetitive tasks in our daily work. In this respect, the application contains a whole host of functionalities that should satisfy every user.
 
 WinAutomation offers the option of copying, moving, editing, compressing, decompressing files or folders, filling and sending forms using data from local documents, creating screenshots, opening and closing program windows, downloading data from any web site to Microsoft Excel or a text file as well as downloading or sending data to an FTP server. 
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
