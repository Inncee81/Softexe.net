This solution is rather for experienced users who are ready to use Windows free from telemetry, Cortan's assistant, almost all Windows Store applications and their connections, home group support, or Windows Defender antivirus.
 
 
 
 In return, we get integrated DirectX 9.0, a system calculator from Windows 7, and a RAID driver to install the system on such disk configurations.
 
 The system image was built using the open source tool MSMG Toolkit. Record it on a flash drive with Rufus best . 
 
 After installation, the system is in the English language version. Links with packages for other language versions with Windows Update can be found here .
