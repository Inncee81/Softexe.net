Windows Data Recovery is a useful tool for repairing, recovering and restoring data on a computer with a Windows operating system.

The application proves to be useful in a situation where, due to a hardware failure, own error or malware, we have lost valuable files. Windows Data Recovery supports FAT32 and NTFS file systems in both the latest version of popular "windows" and older Windows editions (even those that appeared before the release of Windows 2000!). The program also works with external media, such as pendrives or MP3 / MP4 players.
 
 Windows Data Recovery offers as many as three scanning modes: standard, advanced and in-depth, so if we can not recover files using the first of these variants, we can always choose one of the other solutions, so that the program will scrupulously search the indicated partition for data that can be restored.
 
 After scanning, Windows Data Recovery allows you to familiarize yourself with the preview of files. This means that we do not have to restore all lost data, but only need documents, photos, news and more. There is also the option to search for specific files.
