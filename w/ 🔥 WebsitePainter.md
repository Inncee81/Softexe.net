The program is dedicated mainly to novice webmasters and all those who would like to create their own website. It works perfectly when designing both private and corporate websites. All elements that appear on the page can be easily "clicked" with the mouse. It is enough to select the component we are interested in, place it on the project, determine its position and adjust its basic properties.
 
 The process of creating a website is done using the WYSIWYG editor, which supports the latest standards of HTML 5 and CSS 3, as well as JavaScript, PHP and ASP. Among the components offered by WebsitePainter, which can be used by the user were among others text, graphics, various types of shapes, tables, buttons, text boxes, check boxes, forms and many more. The program also gives you the ability to easily add a slide show, photo galleries, all Flash elements, Java applets and YouTube clips to your page.
 
 WebsitePainter allows you to save a ready website on a disk or send it directly to the indicated FTP server. The program supports the Unicode standard, which allows you to create websites in any language. Immediately after installation, a set of several exemplary templates goes into the hands of the user, which can be used when creating your own project.
 
  Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
