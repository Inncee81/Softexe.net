This program supports almost all of the most popular image file formats, video and soundtracks. After importing all materials to the project, the user has the ability to easily and conveniently edit particular aspects of the created slide show. The features offered by the application allow you to apply text to your photos, determine the effects of transitions, or enrich the presentation with a background sound. All introduced changes are visible in the preview in real time. The user can also view the end result in an integrated DVD player emulator at any time.
 
 Within a single project, we can create many new slide shows. We have at our disposal a set of fully configurable menu templates in which the user can, among others, determine the position and size of individual elements. The finished project can be saved as an ISO image on the disk or directly from the tool level burned to a DVD (D5 or D9). Wondershare DVD Creator supports the PAL and NTSC standards.
 
 Among the supported file formats we can find video materials in SD quality (AVI, MP4, MPG, MPEG, 3GP, WMV, ASF, RM, RMVB, DAT, MOV), HD (MTS, M2TS (AVCHD H.264), TS (MPEG- 2), HD MKV (H.264, MPEG-2 HD), HD WMV (VC-1), HD MOV (H.264, MPEG-4) and graphics (BMP, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, GIF).
