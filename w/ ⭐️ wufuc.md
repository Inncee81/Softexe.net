Microsoft has blocked updates from Windows Update on such systems along with patches KB3012218 and KB4012219. wufuc automates the patching process of the wuaueng.dll library containing locking functions.
 
 To use the tool, you should unzip the zip archive to the new directory and run the installer in a batch file (bat). 
 
 the wuff-up will start as a scheduled task with administrator privileges, it will detect the host process for system services in which Windows Update is running and will inject itself into it. After the injection, the LoadLibraryEx function will be inserted to "live" the wuaueng.dll library.
