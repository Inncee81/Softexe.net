Before we start working with the program for good, we will be able to familiarize ourselves with its various options in the tutorial. An exemplary mind map will then be generated, the authors of which will discuss the features offered by WriteMapper.
 
 Individual objects placed on the mind map thanks to the WriteMapper program can be adapted to your own preferences, modifying the appearance of windows, font size and type, as well as the type of lines connecting objects visible on the screen. If necessary, we can always edit notes and graphic elements. There is also the option of changing the theme from light to dark (useful for work at night).
 
 WriteMapper offers support for keyboard shortcuts by means of which we can quickly place new elements, change the appearance of existing entries, format text and perform a number of other necessary actions. Comfortable use is also guaranteed by the option of marking individual objects as completed tasks, thanks to which we know what we should focus our attention on while working.
 
 Importantly, WriteMapper allows you to export your project to HTML, DOC, RTF, TXT and Markdown formats.
