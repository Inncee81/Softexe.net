WindowPadX is an extended version of Window Pad, which allows you to customize the display of windows in the Windows operating system.

Sometimes we can encounter a situation in which, after running a given program, each time we have to manually change the size and position of the window on the screen. With such users in mind, the WindowPadX tool has been created that can remember the location and size of the window, and then when we turn on the application, it will automatically adjust these parameters, saving you time.
 
 WindowPadX is also aimed at people working on several monitors. For example, we can quickly minimize all open windows, move them between screens and more. Importantly, performing these operations, as well as activities described in the above paragraph, is also possible using keyboard shortcuts. Thanks to them, we can easily and quickly maximize or minimize the windows (also to the system tray), block the selected window at the top of the screen, and also give the effect of transparency to selected windows.
 
 However, this is not all, in WindowPadX we can configure the function keys responsible for the operation of the mouse (eg moving the cursor to the center of the screen).
