Windows Privacy Tweaker is an application that allows you to edit privacy and security settings in Windows, mainly through the ability to disable the functions related to telemetry.

It allows you to trace the active services and registry elements, and if necessary, modify them in such a way as to increase anonymity while using the computer. The application itself will tell you what settings should be changed - intense colors inform the user about whether a given function is currently active or not.
 
 Before proceeding with any modifications to the system settings, we recommend creating a restore point so that if there is a problem, you can return to previous configurations. The application itself suggests this step, proposing the creation of a new point already at the launch.
 
 Attention!
 The program is intended primarily for users of Windows 10. In previous versions of the system, only some of the security features are detected.
