With the Wondershare Dr.Fone application, we can recover such data (iPhone 3GS / 4, iPad 1, iPod Touch 4G) as photos and videos from the camera, files in the Photo Stream service, contacts, messages, message attachments, call history, calendar , notes, reminders, favorite sites saved in Safari and voice memos. For iPhone 4S / 5 devices, the program allows you to play items such as messages, contacts, call history, calendar, notes, reminders, Safari tabs.
 
 The program offers two data recovery modes. The first allows you to recover data directly from iPhone 5, iPhone 4S, iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, iPad1 and iPod Touch 4G devices connected to a computer via a USB cable. For iPhone 4S and iPhone 5, you can also use the option to recover data directly from a backup created by iTunes. Before recovering data, Wondershare Dr.Fone offers file previews.
