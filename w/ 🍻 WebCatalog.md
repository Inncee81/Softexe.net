WebCatalog is an open program thanks to which it is possible to run browser applications in the native system window. Thanks to this, it is possible, for example, to use the Gmail or Messanger facebook service without having to run a standard browser.

After launching the application, we gain access to the catalog of popular browser applications. We find services such as, among others, Google Drive, OneDrive, Gmail, Messenger, Instagram, SoundCloud, Twitter or Wikipedia. All you have to do is click the install button to make the site run in a native window, regardless of the browser. The application is based on Chromium engines.
 
 Sites that are launched in this way will be treated by the operating system as native applications, thanks to which their shortcuts will appear in the Start Menu, the icons can also be pinned to the taskbar. The creators of the program have also made it possible to infer about placing further applications in the catalog.
