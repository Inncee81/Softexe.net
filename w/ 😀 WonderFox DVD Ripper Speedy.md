The program has been equipped with a batch processing mode, allowing for comfortable work with more data. Thanks to proper optimization for multi-core processors and GPU acceleration support, it enables very fast copying of media to a computer disk. With its help, we will create backups containing the full contents of a DVD or only selected chapters (useful when you want to skip annoying advertisements during ripping).
 
 WonderFox DVD Ripper Speedy offers the option of removing only basic CSS security that is used by distributors. The tool also allows you to change the basic properties of the copied disc, i.e. the audio codec (AC3 and MP2) and video (MPEG-1/2), image size, FPS number and bitrate, number of audio channels, sampling and volume level used. We will process the processed video on a disk in the PAL or NTSC standard.
