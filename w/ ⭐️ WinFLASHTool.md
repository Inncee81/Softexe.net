The program supports images and memory cards containing more than one partitions and provides the ability to view deleted volumes before overwriting them. WinFLASHTool support is very simple and is limited to indicating the location of the image file, and then clicking the 'Write' button initiating the write operations.
 
 WinFLASHTool has been made available in a portable form (so-called portable), which does not require installation in the system and is ready for operation right after downloading.
