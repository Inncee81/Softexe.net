The program is very easy to use, and the use of it is based on selecting or deselecting various options divided into tabs. In the first one, we will set a general access password, activate the remote access function, enable the display of notifications and specify a list of actions that the user will be able to perform on the hardware after logging in (we will exclude, for example, the option to delete files).
 
 In system settings, we will block access to the control panel, registry editor, start menu, desktop, selected combinations of keyboard shortcuts and mouse buttons, and more. However, these are only general examples, because each category has many additional options to choose from. In addition, WinLock allows you to use the timer, so that after a specified time will log out of the account, lock the computer or completely turn off the PC.
 
 WinLock also allows you to create a list of trusted websites and network sites to which we will have limited access.
