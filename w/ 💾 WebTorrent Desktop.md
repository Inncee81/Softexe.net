> WebTorrent Desktop is a torrent download program that stands out with the ability to open files while downloading them. This may be useful when you want to watch movies - you will not have to wait until the end of the download to begin the session; the application can stream content and at the same time continue the standard download.

The download itself is fast and efficiently maintains the connection. The application is a combination of programs using the bittorent and webtorrent protocols and creates connections ( peers ) from both sources. On a daily basis, the program is very simple to use: the interface is minimalistic and at the beginning there are several files to download. You can add your own, for example, by dropping them in a separate area at the bottom of the application window.
 
 The program settings are not very extensive and only allow you to indicate the path to save downloaded files, the default media player, and enable the application to be started when the system starts.
