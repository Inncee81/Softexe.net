The program will help to properly configure and run, among others, Raspberry Pi 2 or 3, Qualcomm DragonBoard 410c, or Minnowboard MAX, by downloading the correct system compilations for them.
 
 After the initial configuration, the devices will be ready to start creating their own software on them. Beginners have the opportunity to use a database of ready-made examples, which can also be installed on the devices directly from the tool described here.
 
 Attention!
 Installation requires internet connection.
