The authors of WaveCut Audio Editor claim that 90 percent of users use only 10 percent of the program's functions, therefore they have not added many rarely used options, instead focusing on refining the various aspects of the described tool. It is also worth noting that it does not require specialist knowledge on the part of the recipient who can easily and quickly edit any material.
 
 WaveCut Audio Editor is based on the MIDI interface, allowing you to visually edit several recordings at the same time (cutting, copying, pasting, deleting, mixing, mute, trimming), and also allowing fast data exchange via the built-in clipboard. There is also the option of adding various sound effects.
 
 Among the input formats supported by the WaveCut Audio Editor we can find: MP3, OGG, WAV, WMA, AIFF, M4A, AAC, AC3, APE, MPC, FLAC, WV, OPUS, TTA, ALAC and SPEEX. The list of supported output formats is much poorer and limited to the two most popular ones, namely MP3 and WAV.
 
 The speed of the hard disk drive determines how long it will take to perform individual operations in the WaveCut Audio Editor. This would not be possible if it were not for the fact that the tool supports multi-core processors and advanced SIMD instruction sets. Manufacturers also recommend moving the temporary folder to SSD.
