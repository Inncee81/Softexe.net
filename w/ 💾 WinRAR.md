WinRAR - without this popular, very convenient and easy-to-use archiver, it is difficult to imagine everyday work with archives.

Supports work with such archive formats as: RAR, ZIP, 7Z, ACE, ARJ, BZ2, CAB, GZ, JAR, LZH, TAR, UUE, Z, ISO providing maximum speed and compression ratio.

The rich functionality of the WinRAR program should include the ability to restore damaged archives, create self-extracting and multi-volume archives, work with password-protected and encrypted archives, as well as the ability to archive an almost unlimited number of files.

Please note that the program is shareware.

This means that you can download and use it for free for a period specified in the license agreement (40 days) for informational purposes. After that, a message and a reminder about the purchase of the program will begin to appear, but this does not in any way affect the working functionality of the program. You will be able to fully, still free of charge, use this archiver.
