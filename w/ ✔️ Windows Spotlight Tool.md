The program copies all files from the folder in which Windows 10 saves the downloaded background to the folder selected by the user. Therefore, unnecessary files are also copied, we have to deal with deleting them ourselves. This should not be a problem, there are few files of this type, and it is as easy to review them as checking the photo gallery.
 
 Windows Spotlight Tool automatically adds files to the .jpg extension. Of course, the function can be turned off in the settings. In addition, we can decide if we want to see the folder after copying all the files, as well as choose the option to overwrite them.
 
 The program may be mistakenly considered by Windows 10 to be harmful. You should then choose the Run option anyway .
 The tool does not require installation, and it takes less than 1 MB on the disk.
