Mathematica Player allows you to open any document (notebook) created using programs from the Mathematica family. The documents retain fonts, graphics, interactive elements and animations. The calculations are made in real time, so there is no need to attach data sets to documents. The slide display format can be adapted to individual needs. From this program level, no edition of launched publications is possible.
 
 Attention!
 Before downloading the platform, complete the form on the Wolfram Research website and accept the terms of the license agreement. Users of the Mathematica Player program can use interesting, free interactive materials placed in the Wolfram Research repository.
