So we have a specimen of rifles, field medic, engineer or sniper, who have their roles during the clashes. Only a good balance of strength can guarantee victory, and the better we go, the more experience points and the local currency we gain. We can choose a lot of weapons to choose from, and all are modeled on real models, modified, of course, for licensing reasons. It shoots great here.

In addition to the standard deathmat and its team variant or bomb placement, there is, for example, the summoning of enemy raids or the collection of immortals on points. Added to this are missions completed as part of the players' cooperation, the elimination of the indicated goals, knocking out all enemies and a dynamic fight for survival.
