WireframeSketcher is a platform for creating visualizations of graphical interfaces, which is characterized by considerable possibilities, and at the same time very simple operation. It is based on the Eclipse programming environment, popular among Java programmers (not only), offering the same look and arrangement of individual elements. The tool can be successfully used by programmers during the final stages of software development, which is the implementation of the graphical interface. Visualizations created with it can be used as a useful pattern when coding and arranging individual controls on the screen.
 
 There is a rich collection of various types of elements available to the user that can be easily used within the GUI project. We find among them, among others buttons, check boxes, pick lists, sliders, labels, links, menus, progress bars, tables, text boxes, imitations of the web browser and media player, and many, many more. All of them are fully configurable, and their addition to the project is limited to stretches on the form. Ready interface visualization can be saved to a PNG, PDF, HTML file or copied to the system clipboard.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 14 days. In addition, a watermark is applied to the exported project.
