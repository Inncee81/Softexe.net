> Windowed is an unofficial Instagram client, allowing you to view and publish photos from the Windows desktop.

Technically, Windowed is nothing more than a web browser that connects to Instagram. Thanks to the fact that the program is given for a mobile browser, you can also use it to publish photos. Using Instagram with the help of Windowed is no different than using a mobile site on an Android device. 
 
 
 Windowed lets you log in to your account, manage it, publish photos, comment on photos of others and do everything that the mobile Instagram site allows. Unfortunately, it does not give access to filters - here you still need the official application. Fortunately, on the desktop, we are not limited in any way and we can prepare photos in another program.
 
 
 The program is not related to Instagram, its source code is available on GitHub . The application was created with the help of the Electron framework .
