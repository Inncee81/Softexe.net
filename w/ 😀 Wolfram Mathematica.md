Mathematica is over 20 years of work on creating the world's best specialized mathematical environment. The versatility of this program makes it useful in the performance of both simple college bills as well as complex bills on a larger scale, during programming and during the presentation of numerical data. Mathematica will find its place on the student computer and the Nobel Prize winner.

Mathematica perfectly integrates the engine performing numerical and symbolic calculations, graphics engine, programming language, documentation and the possibility of publishing the work. Thanks to the wealth of functions, it is an invaluable tool for the work of mathematicians, physicists, biologists, chemists, financial analysts, sociologists and many others.
 
 The edition "for Students" puts a special emphasis on tools useful in home works from algebra, physics, chemical engineering, astronomy, economics and other subjects requiring data analysis and calculations. In addition to two thousand built-in functions, Mathematica for Students has integrated data sources that are useful in many fields of science. Data can be presented in two- and three-dimensional diagrams. In addition, data can be imported from external sources in over 200 file formats.
 
 The mechanism of creating publications from the Mathematica program is adapted to various types of data visualization and mathematical formulas. Mathematica gives you the ability to create static reports and interactive presentations that can be played using a different version of this program or the free Mathematica Player . The user also has the option of programming interactive elements, which allows to create fully functional applications. Combining text, graphics and user interface elements (buttons, sliders, etc.) gives you a wide range of programming options.
 
 Usually, the use of software requires either knowledge of the language that is specific to it or the use of an interface that allows you to select a part of the function. According to Stephen Wolfram, founder and head of Wolfram Research, both methods limit the user and distract him from the task he is to perform. Mathematica breaks this stereotype. This version of the program can be controlled using English. In addition, Mathematica also has the ability to generate stand-alone executable files and source code in the C language. As a result, all the steps needed to create a complete project, including testing the application, can be done without leaving the environment. In addition, the built-in library of probability distributions has been extended,
 
 Limitations of the trial version
 
 You will be able to use the trial version of the program for 15 days. To obtain it, you must register on the manufacturer's website . When buying a student license, the user can choose a license for one semester, one year or unlimited.
