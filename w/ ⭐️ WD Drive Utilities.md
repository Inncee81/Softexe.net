The tool offers the ability to manage WD drives, as well as allows you to configure them. From the main application window, we can perform device diagnostics, if necessary (eg during incorrect operation of the HDD). By using WD Drive Utilities, we will register the disk on the official website of the manufacturer.
 
 WD Drive Utilities allows formatting a disk or individual pre-created partitions; thanks to it, we can also manage RAID. All this without having to have specialist knowledge. The application is easy to use and intuitive.
