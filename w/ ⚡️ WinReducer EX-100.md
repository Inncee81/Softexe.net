WWinReducer EX-100 is a useful tool for modifying the Windows 10 installation disk. Using it, we adapt the installed operating environment to your needs, removing unnecessary components from it, and adding components that we would have to install at a later stage manually.

One of the basic functions of WinReducer EX-100 is the ability to reduce the size of the installation disk image by removing unnecessary elements from its content, such as fonts, drivers, language versions, graphic compositions, etc. On the other hand, the tool allows the user to integrate its own indexes with the installation media mouse, graphic themes, wallpapers, as well as any applications, drivers, system updates and additional language versions. Importantly, once created configuration can be saved to disk and used in subsequent modification operations.
 
 If we decide to modify the system installation disk, we will need only the ISO image of that system or files copied from it in a traditional way. For the correct operation of the WWinReducer EX-100, additional applications may be required, whose location on the disk should be indicated at the first start-up of the tool.
