Malicious software is often designed to be as hard as possible to detect by standard anti-viruses, which is why sometimes it is worth using an additional tool, which is Winja. It allows you to scan any files on your computer's hard drive or any media (eg pendrive), as well as running processes, so that we can find out if our computer is free from malware.
 
 Winja also offers the possibility of using additional tools that allow for an in-depth analysis of the operating system and individual data carriers, as well as make the malware not only detected but also removed.
