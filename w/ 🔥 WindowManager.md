The program offers many options thanks to which the user can customize its operation to his own needs, by defining rules related to the way in which particular windows are displayed. We can also find here the possibility of defining keyboard shortcuts allowing for quick creation of new rules for launching specified applications or using previously prepared solutions.
 
 Interestingly, WindowManager offers the option of blocking the size and position of windows, so that it always opens in the same place regardless of whether it will be moved by the user during work. The tool - after prior configuration - can also perform simple tasks using the mouse and keyboard, automatically run the indicated applications and more.
 
 WindowManager works in both Windows Explorer and various programs. Some users will appreciate the fact that the application can handle multiple monitors, and also allows you to create several profiles.
