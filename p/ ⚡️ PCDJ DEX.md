PCDJ DEX is a professional tool for DJs and musicians, designed for mixing sounds and music on a computer. The application is characterized by a huge number of different functions that support the creation and mixing of sounds. In addition, it reads the entire contents of Audio CDs and supports the most popular formats of MP3, OGG, AVI, MOV, MKV, FLAC, M4A and many more.

In the program, we can create and mix music using ready-made loops, sound files (samples), an acoustic spectrum analyzer, and using various effects to manipulate the sound being played. In addition, we'll find the necessary Beat Skip function to skip along the length and breadth of the song without falling out of the rhythm. It is also worth mentioning the tool for simulating work with a vinyl record, which has additional effects of slowing down or playing from the back of any music piece. 
 
 
 The program interface is extensive and convenient to use. It consists of a professional and multi-functional mixer, playlists of sounds and songs, and various elements for karaoke and mixing of video materials. PCDJ DEX has better organization and management of the media library and ID3 tag editions compared to the previous edition of the program. 
 
 
 The program has an automatic BPM detection, an option to monitor the main signal, and fully supports effects using free VST plugins. There were also features to automatically adjust the volume level of the songs. The advantage of the PCDJ DEX application is the ability to cooperate with other devices exclusively for DJs (DENON DN-HC4500, Stanton SCS.4Dj, American Audio VM4 or Zomo MC1000).
 
 Attention!
  The PCDJ DEX program is available in a demo version and will automatically shut down after 30 minutes of testing.
