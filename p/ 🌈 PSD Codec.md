PSD Codec is a plugin that adds the ability to preview PSD and PSB files in applications such as Windows Explorer, Windows Photo Viewer, Windows Photo Gallery and Windows 7 Media Center.

Currently supported color spaces include: RGB with depth of 8 bits per channel, indexed, CMYK and shades of gray. The preview for these files will be shown even if the program does not find a thumbnail attached to the file, as long as there is an image available in which the layers are connected.
 
 PSD Codec, apart from adding the preview function of files created using the Adobe Photoshop application (PSD, PSB) to programs built into Windows, also extends their functionality by generating thumbnails of such formats as AI, EPS, PDD, INDD and PDF files in the case of the program installed in the system Adobe Reader. After PSD Codec installation, you will also be able to view XMP, IPTC and EXIF ​​metadata.
 Attention!
 
 If you upgrade the PSD Codec extension to a newer version, the manufacturer recommends uninstalling the previous one at that time. 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 15 days.
