The program supports the most popular forms PIT-28, PIT-36, PIT-37, as well as 20 other tax declarations, forms and attachments. He does not have limitations on the number of persons accounted for and allows to complete PIT declarations for entire families, friends, etc.
 
 PIT Format allows you to make annual tax settlements in two modes. The first one is based on a wizard that guides the user step by step and is directed to less experienced taxpayers. The second one, however, allows you to fill PIT yourself and was created for users familiar with current tax regulations.
 
 The application allows you to transfer the amount of 1% of tax due to the selected OPP organization. The ready testimony can be saved in the program, printed or submitted electronically via the Internet.
