The program allows for the issuance and printing of documents such as waste acceptance forms (contracts), waste transfer cards, waste record cards, invoices (VAT transferred to the buyer), PZ / WZ / MM warehouse documents and KP / KW cash documents. The Purchase Point runs a raw materials warehouse, prints purchase, sales, commodity trading, cash and many more reports.
 
 It allows you to create your own price list, in which under one main code it is possible to assign any number of sub-types of waste and give them different purchase and sale prices. Invoices meet the requirements of the latest regulations and take into account the transfer of VAT to the buyer. The program can also document the recovery of raw materials including losses.
