All you need to do after starting Pixillion is to select files, specify the output format from the drop down list, and then click the button responsible for converting and waiting for results. Interestingly, the program makes it possible to protect materials with watermarks and subtitles.
 
 Among the file formats supported by the Pixillion application we can find mainly JPG, PNG, GIF, NEF, ICO, RAW and PDF. The tool can convert individual images, but of course, there is nothing to prevent it from working in batch mode, allowing the user to save a lot of time.
 
 Pixillion offers an uncomplicated editor, thanks to which we can change the orientation of a given image, as well as its size. In this way, you can modify the weight of a given file so that it can be sent via e-mail or made available on the Facebook, Twitter or other social networks.
