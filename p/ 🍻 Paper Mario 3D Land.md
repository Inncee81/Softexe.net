```sh
Paper Mario 3D Land is an extremely colorful and at the same time free fan production with a popular plumber in the lead role. This free project draws inspiration from the hero's classic two-dimensional adventures, as well as from games where the characters were cut out of cardboard. Everything was skillfully combined and as a result we got a well-developed platformer with a very distinctive graphic setting.

We're dealing with an interesting combination of a three-dimensional world with flat 2D objects. Mario himself revolves around it on his own axis. The game features all the classic elements of the popular series. So here are the opponents in the form of mushrooms or turtles, coins and stars to collect, as well as blocks with a question mark, from which sometimes fall special powers, facilitating gameplay.
 
 
 There is of course a flower that gives fireballs, but the creator of the project also added some of his own original bonuses. Among them you will find even a green outfit of a plant, allowing you to glide or a mole costume, thanks to which you will get to many secret treasure rooms. The product successfully follows the path that Mario and the company have trodden over the years. It offers many interestingly made stages.
