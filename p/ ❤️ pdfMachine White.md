The program allows you to generate a document from almost any application that offers a print option. PDF file with selected content may have been created, among others from the Windows Explorer, as well as from a text editor, image files browser, etc. It is enough to select the 'Print' option from the application menu (or press the Ctrl + P key combination), and then select the virtual printer 'Broadgun pdfMachine' . The tool will generate a PDF document for us and ask where it should be saved.
 
 pdfMachine White offers only the simplest functions that allow you to conveniently create a PDF. If you want to use the option of securing publication with a password or applying a watermark, you should count on adding a short information from the authors of the program on each page of the document.
