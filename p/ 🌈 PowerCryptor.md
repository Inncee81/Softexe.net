The described application uses advanced encryption, including 256-bit AES and Blowfish, thanks to which our confidential documents, private photos, valuable sound files and important video materials will not get into the hands of third parties. PowerCryptor also allows you to completely delete files without the possibility of restoring them, which can be useful when you need to get rid of documents and do not want them to be recovered by unauthorized users.
 
 PowerCryptor is characterized by simplicity of operation. Performing operations such as opening, editing or saving encrypted files will not cause any trouble to anyone. The tool also allows you to create a self-decrypting .exe file (256-bit AES encryption) secured with a password that we can send by email.
 
 PowerCryptor includes an extensive password generator for use when securing data, and also allows you to encrypt text messages. Both of these functions are available from the level of separate applications, which after installing the tool appear in the form of additional icons on the desktop.
