In addition, there are functions for drawing gradients and changing the color settings and various shades. 
 
 
 Using the program, we can freely configure individual elements on the main screen, as well as add various effects of glows and shadows. Pixelitor also offers the option of undoing and repeating all performed operations on a modified photograph or drawing.
