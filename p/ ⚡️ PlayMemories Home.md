PlayMemories Home is a tool for managing media on your computer's hard drive and other media. The program also allows you to edit movies and photos in many different ways.

If you have a large library of photos or videos that you would not like to lose, for example as a result of a failure, you should log in to the free PlayMemories Online service to be able to store your multimedia "in the cloud". This service offers 5 GB of free space on the server. Since we already talk about network functions, it's worth adding that PlayMemories Home includes the option of sharing files via popular social networking sites.
 
 PlayMemories Home allows you to sort multimedia by various criteria (eg after creation date), and the ability to display a folder tree makes finding the necessary directories much easier. Each of the photographs we have can be freely edited, eg removing the red-eye effect or framing the picture.
 
 With PlayMemories Home, we will start the photos as a slide show. It's the best solution to show all the photos from family celebrations or holidays. In addition, it is possible to create a time-lapse movie in which images selected by the user will be found.
