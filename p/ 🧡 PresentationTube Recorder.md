> PresentationTube Recorder is a powerful tool that allows you to record activities performed on your computer while recording the image of the webcam and user's statements.

Similarly to many other programs of this type, PresentationTube Recorder is used to prepare extensive multimedia presentations or instructional videos. Against the background of similar tools, it distinguishes itself by focusing on the possibility of presenting and registering individual slides from Microsoft PowerPoint, and also allows presenting content placed even on a special whiteboard (additional space for entering key information) or via a web browser (e.g. YouTube videos).  
 
 PresentationTube Recorder is characterized by a clear user interface. Although it may seem illegible at first, all the necessary options are available at your fingertips. The main part of the window is occupied by a presentation, and around there are various icons, allowing, among other things, to quickly start or stop recording, or to gain access to the presented slides.
