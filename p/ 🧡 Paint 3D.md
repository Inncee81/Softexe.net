As the name suggests, the application allows you to prepare three-dimensional objects. They can be models of figures, figures or various elements of the landscape. Paint 3D also offers the option of creating sketches using the 3D effect. In addition to numerous tools addressed to work in three-dimensional mode, the tool also received many new types of brushes.
 
 Interestingly, while working, we can enrich your project by placing 3D models in it, as well as adding pictures in the form of eye-catching stickers. There was also the possibility of applying numerous graphic effects, cropping images or adding text options.
 
 Paint 3D also emphasizes the social aspect. We will put our works without any problems online through the Remix3D.com website, where we can also find 3D models or graphics by other users from around the world. The application also includes the function of recording the creation process that we can share on the internet to show how our work was created.
 
 Paint 3D provides a completely different, completely redesigned user interface that not only looks modern, but also makes all the options you need available at your fingertips.
