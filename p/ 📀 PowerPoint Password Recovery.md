The program can recover lost or forgotten passwords securing access to these files using three different methods - brute-force, attack using a mask and a dictionary. It perfectly copes with documents created using the PowerPoint application in the versions 2016, 2013, 2010, 2007, 2003, XP, 2000 and 97, and also allows breaking the password blocking the editing option. The advantage of the tool is additional support for hardware acceleration through modern NVIDIA and AMD graphics cards and multithreaded processing, which allows you to speed up the process of password recovery.
