The program can recover lost or forgotten passwords securing access to PDF files using three different methods - brute-force, attack using a mask and a dictionary. It copes well with documents created using the Adobe Acrobat application and many others that offer such a feature, and also allows you to remove restrictions on printing, editing or copying PDF content. The advantage of the tool is additional support for hardware acceleration through modern NVIDIA and AMD graphics cards and multithreaded processing, which allows you to speed up the process of password recovery.
 
 PDF Password Recovery, despite the lack of the Polish language version, will certainly not cause any problems to anyone. The tool is operated using a built-in wizard that guides you through the process of password cracking step-by-step.
