> PhotoScissors is another, very simple and fast graphic tool from this manufacturer, which this time was created with the aim of extracting objects from photos and removing unnecessary background. It's enough for the user to define the elements of the image he would like to leave, and the advanced algorithms will automatically get rid of the rest.

The application was created with the amateurs of graphics in mind and is a remarkable alternative to other, mostly very complex and expensive solutions of this type. It is equipped only with a set of tools that allow efficient extraction of selected objects from the pictures. We will not find any additional functions in it, for example basic graphics processing.
 
 Working with the program is based on manually applying the mask to the elements of the image that we would like to leave or remove. With the mouse pointer, we paint over the green areas that we would like to keep, while in red we define the elements to be removed. Later cutting out the application deals with itself.
 
 The user is also given the option of cropping and resizing the image output.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version has restrictions that do not allow you to save the edited image.
