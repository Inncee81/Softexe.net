The program proves to be helpful during the preparation of web applications (Database Publishing, Web-to-Print, PIM, DMS, MDM, DAM, WCMS, VDP, etc.). PDFreactor supports HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript (along with the API for this language), Java, PHP, .NET, Python, Ruby, Perl, Node.js, SOAP and others.
 
 PDFreactor includes professional printing features, allows you to create tagged PDF documents, and even lets you transfer JavaScript layouts to PDF. Notably, converting HTML 5 (all tags of this language are supported) to PDFs is done without additional pre-processing.
