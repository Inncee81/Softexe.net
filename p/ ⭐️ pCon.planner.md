For interior design, you can insert CAD models in many formats (DWG, SKP, 3DS) or downloaded from available catalogs of furniture and equipment manufacturers (the library can be found on the program's website ). There are also various materials that can be easily assigned to the visualization planes. The program makes it possible to create materials, apply them to ready-made models and adapt the delivered objects to the decorated interior. 
 
 
 
 pCon.planner copes well with visualizations of designed interiors and generates high quality, photorealistic renderings (Yafaray and OSPRay renders are available), without any special knowledge of 3D graphics. The program also allows you to generate presentations containing detailed visual and textual information that can be shown to clients, associated with the actual scale and containing descriptive tables.
 
 The manufacturer also provides mobile applications in which you can present a panoramic view and interactive images on tablets.
