The program interface is similar to the Windows 10 Action Center, so using it may resemble the use of functions integrated with the system. All functions offered by the package, however, are in fact small applications that can also be run independently from the panel itself, using the appropriate shortcuts. The panel itself is only a convenient preview of all tools in one place.
 
 The applications themselves are small and designed to require at most a few clicks to perform the operations we are interested in. For example, to download a video from YouTube simply drag its link to the area of ​​the relevant application.
 
 Attention!
 
 The program's trial edition is limited to 7 days of operation.
 To use the program, it is necessary to set up a free user account or log in using data from Facebook or Google.
