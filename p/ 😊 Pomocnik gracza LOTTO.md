The application has been equipped with functions to download the current results of game draws from the Totalizator Sportowy server. Its main task is to search for winnings in previously defined files with user-selected numbers. The LOTTO player helper does not support system bets and offers the possibility to search simultaneously many files with bets of a given game.
