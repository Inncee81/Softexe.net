 Party Hard contains five playable characters. You play as a guy who dreams about just getting enough sleep. We also direct the policeman (he can move the body without arousing any suspicions), ninja (quick, can not be detected, and additionally has a smoke bomb), a girl who can get rid of people and a butcher equipped with a chainsaw.
 
 Party Hard fun focuses on skilfully eliminating more inhabitants. The creators have prepared 19 unique levels, offering semi-procreate generated locations, which means that we can count on the presence of various new products at every game. Unexpected situations may make it difficult for us to complete the task, leading to the detection of our hero.
 
 In addition to the one-person mode, Party Hard allows local collaboration with another player.
