The rules of the PUBG game - just like in other games of this type - are really simple. We start the fun on the plane, from which we jump out to land on a huge map. A maximum of one hundred players fighting for each other's survival participate in one session. Each of them begins their adventure without any equipment, which is why in the initial phase of the game we need to find a weapon, and if we will be lucky, add to it improvements and equip themselves even in makeshift armor.
 
 After some time, the huge location begins to shrink, so everyone playing Playerunknown's Battlegrounds must reach the designated area at a given time - if it does not, they will lose their health points. The game ends when one person stays on the map. However, this is not the rule, because apart from being able to play alone, PUBG offers a team mode, where together with several other people we try to stay alive, and at the moment of our character's death another team member will resurrect the fallen hero.
 
 The game in Playerunknown's Battlegrounds can be viewed from the perspective of the third or first person. The option of freely switching between these modes is available on each server, but otherwise we can join the session, where all players observe events from the first-person view (without the option of changing to a third-person perspective).
