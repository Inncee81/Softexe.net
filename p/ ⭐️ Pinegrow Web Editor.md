While preparing websites is not an easy task, Pinegrow Web Editor tries to simplify them as much as possible. While working on HTML files, we do not need to add any styles or templates to the source code, nor do we need to import or export anything - we do all the actions from one HTML document saved on the hard disk of our computer.
 
 Pinegrow Web Editor contains a number of tools designed to enhance the visual appearance of the site being prepared. You can add, edit, move, clone and of course delete HTML elements to create your dream website. Everything is done in real time, so we have a continuous preview of our site (even when placing dynamic JavaScript objects).
 
 Interestingly, Pinegrow Web Editor supports both the Bootstrap and Foundation methods. The user gets the option of dragging selected elements to the website and customizing them according to preferences. The tool automatically adjusts attributes and even HTML code. In addition, the application supports AngularJS and 960 Grid.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 7 days.
