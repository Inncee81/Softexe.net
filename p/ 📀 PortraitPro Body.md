PortraitPro Body is a retouching program designed to work with the whole body, issued by PortraitPro authors. The advantage of the program is fast work - in a few minutes you can slim and shape the body, gently change position, smooth the skin and the muscles of the model or model.

The program is very intuitive. At the beginning, the face, joints and contours of the body of the model or model should be marked with special guides. Further corrections can be made with the help of easy-to-use sliders, thus determining the thickness and length of the limbs, waist height, roundness of shapes, shoulder width and the like, different for men and women. The parameters are quite detailed to give the possibility to refine the shapes of the body in the picture. Of course, you sometimes have to reckon with the fact that the background will be slightly disturbed after changing the shape of the character.
 
 
 The program also has several tools for manual retouching, reminiscent of what "forming" offers in Photoshop. You can smooth out the edges, reduce or enlarge parts of the body with brushes, move parts of the image and so on. At any time, you can use the preview before and after the changes, smooth the skin of the person in the picture, carry out a base face retouching, and finally also apply effects to the photo. 
 
 
 The program is available in two versions. The basic one described here works independently, and the more advanced Studio can act as a plug-in for Photoshop, open RAWs and work in different color spaces. The trial version of the program displays the watermark on the screen and has the limitations of file entries.
