With the help of the application, we can complete the testimony PIT-28, PIT-36, PIT-36L, PIT-37, PIT-38, PIT-39, PIT-16A and PIT-19A and a full range of attachments, and later print or submit completed declarations by Internet. The program performs calculations and the user has to fill only the necessary fields. The user does not even have to have information about the target Tax Office, he only chooses it from the list. Work on PIT can be saved and continued at any time. All forms have a built-in data transfer to the e-Deklaracje system.
 
 What is important, the data entered into one print can be exported to another, so you do not have to enter the same data repeatedly. An additional advantage of the program is assistance with the principles of completing the declaration. You can enter any Public Benefit Organization, use the list of almost 30 Organization items proposed by the author or use the OPP search engine link.
 
 The program will provide information on the allocation of each PIT, detailed information on discounts and other such as the amount of tax deductible costs or the amount of thresholds. PITY 2017 also allows you to print direct debits. The program was also accompanied by a unified text of the Personal Income Tax Act.
 
 Attention!
 
 
 Pursuant to the provisions of the license, "persons using a free license undertake to indicate in a statement of any public benefit Organization, which the Tax Office will transfer the amount of 1% of tax due ..."
