Phototheca is a small graphical browser that is characterized by high speed of operation. It offers features that conveniently manage a large number of digital photos, as well as view and present them in the form of a slide show.

The foundation of this simple application is an interesting mechanism for cataloging photographs. With its help, we can select the import of a photo and assign it to selected events or albums. The latter are nothing but standard catalogs with graphics. Noteworthy, however, is the mode of events, which allows you to organize your photos in relation to a given event, such as a wedding, childbirth, holiday trip, etc., and then present it on the timeline or calendar built into the Phototheca program. Of course, the user can easily convert events to the form of albums.
 
 Other functions that Phototheca has been equipped with are a full-screen slide show taking into account selected photographs. There were also options to set the photo as a desktop wallpaper. Unfortunately, the application only supports a handful of the most popular graphic formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP), among which we will not find RAW files from digital cameras. The free version also has a limited library size - 5,000 images.
