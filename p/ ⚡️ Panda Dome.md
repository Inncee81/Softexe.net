The application was created as the successor of Panda Cloud Antivirus , one of the first antivirus solutions that use so-called computing cloud. Like its predecessor, Panda Dome is based on processes and resources located on Panda's external servers. In addition to the slightly changed name, the software has the same functionality and appearance of the graphical interface, characterized by lightness and speed of operation and a negligible demand for system resources.
 
 Panda Dome provides computer protection in real time, protecting the system from outside infections. It offers on-demand scanning functions, during which all the contents of the hard disk are checked, the locations most susceptible to virus activity or folders indicated by the user. The program also has options for detecting potentially dangerous components, background scanning after cache synchronization, conservative blocking, behavioral analysis, archives analysis during on-demand scanning, and blocking of virus files until receiving the appropriate results from the cloud.
 
 The application also includes options for scheduling scan tasks, event reporting and quarantine, in which potentially dangerous data is stored. Noteworthy is the process monitor, whose task is to analyze all processes operating within the system and to warn the user about those that could be a source of danger. From the level of Panda Dome, we will also create a rescue USB drive, help while running an already infected computer.
