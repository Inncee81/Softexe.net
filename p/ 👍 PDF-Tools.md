The program includes more than 50 different tools that have been categorized in affordable categories. We find among them that allow easy creation of documents in PDF format, adding and deleting various elements from their content, converting between different formats, or optimizing or securing access to them.
 
 Thanks to this simple tool, we will easily create a PDF document based on graphic and text files, convert documents created by MS Office to PDF, remove or add new pages, enrich publications with headers and footers, secure documents with a watermark, remove all kinds of documents comments or links, we will separate graphics, etc. 
 
 Despite the large possibilities, PDF-Tools remains an easy-to-use tool, accessible even to novice users.
 
 Attention!
 
 The test version imposes a watermark on the output PDF documents with information from the program's producer.
