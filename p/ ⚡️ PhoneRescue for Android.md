After starting PhoneRescue for Android, you must connect your Android device to your computer via the USB connector. You should also activate the USB debugging function located in the programming options of your smartphone or tablet, and check whether your equipment works in airplane mode.
 
 From the main window of PhoneRescue for Android, we can select or deselect the data we would like to restore. Available categories include contacts, call history, news, calendar, photos, music, video, documents and more. Once we have done this, click "next" to let the program start scanning (quick or accurate). However, before this happens, we must allow the application to access our mobile device.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version of PhoneRescue for Android does not allow you to save the recovered data. To do this, you must purchase the program.
