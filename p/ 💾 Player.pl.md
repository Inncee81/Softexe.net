Navigating the tiled interface is quite simple and intuitive, and the materials are divided thematically. Among the categories we find, among others entertainment, guides, cuisine, health and beauty or moto and sport. In each of the above, there are subcategories constituting the names of programs and individual episodes with short descriptions. Full functionality will be obtained after creating an account in the service. We will then be able to continue watching from the moment we closed the app and add individual titles to favorites. Unfortunately, the application is unstable and often watching the program is interrupted by an unexpected crash. Another downside is advertising, often before and during watching.
 
 The advantages of tvn player are a transparent and functional interface, which is convenient to use both on the tablet and smartphone, as well as a rich and up-to-date video library. On the other hand, the instability and long time of loading programs are hindered.
