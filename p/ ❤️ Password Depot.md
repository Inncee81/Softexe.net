Working with the program is based on the so-called groups, or encrypted databases, in which the user saves data and information that he would like to protect. They are nothing more than a secure file on the hard disk that can store up to thousands of items. In order to provide additional security for valuable data for us, we can choose a group with passwords to be placed anywhere outside the computer, e.g. on a portable external memory or memory card. The tool is a very good protection of our data against force attacks, dictionary attacks or keyloggers, stealing information entered using the keyboard. Another useful feature is to protect the system clipboard.
 
 When adding more passwords to Password Depot, their strength and time is needed to break them. The tool allows, of course, automatic generation of secure passwords based on eg a selected word, as well as automatic entering of passwords in a web browser. All data collected within the program are protected by double encryption with the AES algorithm (Rijndael 256) - using the main program password and the internal key. There was also a virtual screen keyboard function.
 
 Attention!
 
 After installing the program for 30 days, it works in the full version mode. After this time, it automatically transforms into a free edition, offering such limitations as, for example, the ability to store a maximum of 20 passwords.
