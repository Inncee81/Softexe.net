> PhotoFiltre Studio X is a powerful tool that allows you to edit various graphic files. With its help, we will be able to primarily take care of photo retouching, but not only - the manufacturer took care of the availability of options for less and more demanding users.

The program is characterized by a transparent, though relatively rich interface. Most of the screen occupies a window in which the selected photograph is located. We can perform basic image modifications, including resizing, adding frames, cropping, adding shadows, increasing brightness or changing contrast, red-eye reduction, and entering a short text (e.g., a signature).
 
 PhotoFiltre Studio X also allows you to work on layers and offers the possibility of using advanced graphic filters, among which there is m.in. image smoothing, sharpening, sepia, grayscale, embossing, crystallization, distortion, old photography, watercolor and oil painting. Gamma correction, option to change exposure and color saturation, and much more are also available.
 
 With PhotoFiltre Studio X we can not only edit files, but also create gifs using available images. The tool supports the following graphic file formats: TIFF, PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, TGA and ICO.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
 Crack to the program is available in our section PROGRAMS -&gt; Extras -&gt; Polish locations (see: Related Programs).
