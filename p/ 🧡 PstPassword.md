> PstPassword is a very small and easy-to-use tool that allows you to recover a lost password to the Personal Folders (PST) file of the Microsoft Outlook e-mail client.

The application allows the user to load the selected PST file, and then gives access to the forgotten password. In addition, it also displays information such as coding and its version, CRC checksum, password, full path to the file, its size, date of modification and any errors that may occur. All this data can be saved as a report in the form of a text file or HTML.
 
 PstPassword does not require the Outlook mail client being installed in the system to be part of the Microsoft Office suite. For proper operation of the tool, it is enough to have the PST file, which contains personal folders as well as copies of e-mails. 
 
 The current version of PstPassword supports PST files created by Outlook in versions 97, 2000, XP, 2003, 2007, 2013 and 2016.
 
 Attention!
 Crack to the program is available in the section PROGRAMS -&gt; Extras -&gt; Polish locations (see: Related Programs).
