> One of the best programs for generating documents in PDF format.

PDF files can be generated from any program that has a printing option. pdfFactory installs in the system in the form of a printer with the same name - creating PDF documents is done by "printing" to this printer. Each document is automatically optimized, and before saving we can preview it, delete unnecessary pages, add blanks, and even combine several PDF files.
 
 What is perhaps the most important, pdfFactory as a few, allows you to generate PDF files containing hyperlinks (links) to websites or e-mail addresses. Rapid generation of documents also deserves praise.
