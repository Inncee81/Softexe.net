PDF Page Lock is very easy to use. All you have to do is open a PDF, select the pages to block, and then give the password and save the document. The user who receives it will not have access to protected fragments (he will see only blank pages with a padlock icon). It is also possible to hide selected pages so that the person familiarizing with the document would not be aware that it received an incomplete PDF. 
 
 PDF Page Lock allows you to unlock access to blocked or hidden pages of a PDF document with just one click.
