In fact, the program functions as a BitTorrent client, giving the possibility to transmit multimedia in accordance with the P2P communication model. Such a solution has its advantages and disadvantages - active Internet connection is required to watch movies, but on the other hand video materials are ready to be played almost immediately (without having to download them to disk). Among the media available in Popcorn Time, we find such in high quality: 720p or 1080p. Although all available content has been divided into categories, the user is also offered an in-built search engine that facilitates finding specific titles.
 
 All films available in the database are available in the English language version. The developers of the application, however, came up to meet the expectations of users from around the world and offer the possibility of displaying subtitles for films in many languages ​​(including Polish). If there is no translation in your language, Popcorn Time allows you to read and display external subtitles. At our disposal there are also options for manipulating the size of subtitles.
 
 Attention!
 
 By default, the program is run in the English language version. The Polish interface can be activated from the configuration options.
