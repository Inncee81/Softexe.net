> Pile is an example of a genius in its simplicity, a free application to manage duties, tasks or projects to be implemented.

It gives you the ability to organize tasks for more than one person or to handle work on many different projects. It can be successfully used as a personal organizer, but also as a program supporting the work of a programmer or a website creator.
 
 Pile knocks down notes with valuable information in a very convenient way and create task lists (TODO) for execution. In addition, what is unusual in the competition, within the "drag-and-drop" application, it is possible to create shortcuts to important PDF documents, text files, spreadsheets, etc., which we would like to read at a later time.
 
 The program was created based on Electron technology and is available for the Windows, Linux and Mac OS platforms.
