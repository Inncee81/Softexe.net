Photon is a tool for creating and sharing screenshots, which also allows you to capture OCR content and record activities carried out on the desktop to a video file in MP4 or AVI format.

After taking a screenshot of the area selected by the user using the Photon application, he can share it via the web (eg by e-mail, Facebook or Twitter), save it to the clipboard and copy it to any document (eg presentation), and save on hard drive or portable device or print. 
 
 From the main program window, we can define key tool options. I am talking primarily about the recording path and file formats of screenshots and recorded video materials. It is also possible to enter text into a work using a predefined font of any color and size. If necessary, Photon also allows you to restore the default settings.
 
 Photon is characterized by a minimal user interface. When using the application, all the necessary functions are placed on two (horizontal and vertical) transparent bars filled with necessary icons, thanks to which we have very fast access to the necessary options, and the application works in a discreet way.
