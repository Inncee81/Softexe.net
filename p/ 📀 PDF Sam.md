Individual operations on documents are made from the level of appropriate tabs that present plugins installed in the program. It is thanks to them that we can easily and conveniently divide the PDF file into part (the options available are single pages, extracting selected pages, dividing by odd and even pages and the size indicated), we rotate all or only selected pages by the given angle, we change their order or we will remove unwanted items from the document. We can save finished projects to PDF files in versions 1.5, 1.6 or 1.7, also subjecting them to compression. PDF Sam offers a built-in PDF viewer that allows you to view documents without having to save them and use additional software for this purpose. The application can work with documents to which access has been secured with a password.
 
 The program was written in Java and can be run on any computer with a Java runtime environment installed, i.e. operating under the control of Windows, Linux or Mac OS. The interface, although it looks a bit outdated, is intuitive and easy to use, also offering support for graphic motifs. A small disadvantage of PDF Sam is the lack of full localization. Using the tool it is not difficult to find the options, commands, etc. available in English.
