The program offers the option of automatically improving colors, color intensity and changing the contrast with one click. The intelligent system responsible for performing these operations saves a lot of time on the part of the user. Thanks to the work on the layers, you can freely correct individual parts of the edited photo.
 
 PhotoEQ includes the option to work in batch mode, which allows you to apply the same effects in all photos. However, nothing prevents some effects or corrections from being introduced on selected images. There is a variant of using automatic settings, as well as the function of editing photos manually.
 
 The file formats supported by PhotoEQ include: JPEG, JPEG2000, TIFF, PSD, PNG, BMP, PGM, PPM and JPEG XR, as well as RAW formats: dng, .crw, .cr2, .mrw, .nef, .raf,. orf, .pef, .srf, multicolored Projects can be saved to JPEG, TIFF, PNG, BMP and PSD.
 
 PhotoEQ is ideally suited for home users. An easy-to-use and legible interface located in the right part of the screen (the remaining one occupies the editing window) contains all the necessary functions for correcting photos.
