The game features precisely targeted models of specific elements that can be mounted in a PC. The library is quite rich, but you have to bear in mind that not all configurations will make sense. The game is at an early stage of development and the priority was to refine the action. 
 
 
 
 The simulator not only allows you to select parts from the catalog, but also requires manual screwing and tape connection. 
 
 
 The game is available for "what a favor", which means you can buy it at any price or download it for free.
