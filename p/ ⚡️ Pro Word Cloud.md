Pro Word Cloud is a plugin for the Office suite that allows you to build a "cloud" of words and generate a picture from the Word or PowerPoint selected in the text.

The tool allows you to choose one of several typefaces, a color scheme, word layout, as well as the maximum number of words and size of the image. The program recognizes the language of the text and tries to remove conjunctions and popular words, but is not always able to do so. 
 
 
 With the help of the program, you can generate a decorative element on the page, an interesting summary of the text, and even graffitti for use in another project. 
 
 
 The extension works in Worskie and PowerPoint 2013 and newer.
