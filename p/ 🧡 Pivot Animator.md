The uncomplicated user interface and very simple models of objects visible on the screen make Pivot Animator an ideal program for people who would like to prepare a modest stop-motion animation. It is also worth noting that the described tool does not require specialist knowledge on the part of a person sitting in front of a computer and is used, among others, in computer science lessons in a primary school, where students can create their own projects.
 
 Pivot Animator offers the possibility of drawing more models of characters, animals or other objects, and also allows you to import figures and backgrounds that we add to the animation. If we decide on the first solution, the application will launch the built-in Stick Figure Builder tool to create objects using lines and circles containing red dots, which are places that will put our works in motion.
