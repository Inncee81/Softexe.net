For the application, simply upload any photo, and then apply a filter to it, previously selecting it from the list of available proposals. These can be sorted by category or date of adding a filter to the base. Overlays are various and combined with the subsequent configuration, you can count on unique effects.
 
 For ease of use, the application allows you to remember your favorite overlays to later reach them faster. The settings allow, among other things, to manage the program's cache. In the free version Painnt allows you to save images with the maximum HD resolution and the logo imprinted in the bottom corner of the photo.
