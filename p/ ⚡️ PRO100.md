PRO100 offers five display modes of the project (skeleton, sketch, colors, textures and full visualization), allows you to work immediately on a 3D view and provides you with seven views of the designed space. Working with the program recreates the process of creating a real piece of furniture, making life easier for designers and editors. The user uses furniture elements (pieces), arranging them in a virtual space. PRO100 supports designers of all types of kitchen, office, room, industrial, and even laboratory furniture and playgrounds. 
 
 In addition, the program gives you the opportunity to create your own furniture and material libraries, generate any printouts, perform valuations, generate production reports and much, much more. The strength of PRO100 is an extremely realistic module for 3D visualization with lighting simulation, a rich base of furniture, elements of equipment (including household appliances) and interior finishing of leading manufacturers, as well as very simple operation.
 The program includes the latest collections of home appliances: Amica, Candy, Fagor, Mastercook. Collections of table tops: Lupus, Pfleiderer, Resopal, Duropal. Furniture fronts of companies: Dre, Drewpol, Lupus, Restol, Sławpol and Pfleiderer furniture boards. Collections of sanitary ceramic solids of the following brands: Koło, Roca, Duscholux, Excellent and collections of Tubądzin, Paradyż, Cerkolor and Incitare tiles.
 
 The PRO100 program requires a NVIDIA GeForce 9600 graphics card, ATI Radeon X1900 or better. When using Pro100, it is worth reaching for Nowy Rozkrój , which will help to prepare furniture production and optimally plan the cutting of boards.
