Playnite is a free (open-source license) tool for managing your own library of computer games. Thanks to it, we will have access to all of your titles from one application.

In the era of digital games, we have to "jump" between various services to launch the selected production. We have some of them on Steam, others can only be found on Origin, GOG, Battle.net or Uplay. However, we can deal with this problem and install the free Playnite application, to which we will import only installed or all games we have in digital versions.
 
 Playnite offers a very simple and uncomplicated wizard, thanks to which we will configure the tool step by step at the first launch. In addition to the ability to import games from services such as Steam, Origin, GOG, Battle.net and Uplay, there is also an option to add games not available in the above-mentioned digital stores (eg DRM-free versions from old magazines).
 
 Preparation of the tool takes only a few dozen seconds, including the time it takes to download the metadata. Playnite automatically downloads detailed information about the titles we have (eg a cover or description). Interestingly, the app also has a timer for the given title. Although this option is included on Steam or Origin, it is not available in all clients of the most popular digital services (eg on Battle.net).
 
 Playnite, unfortunately, requires the launch of dedicated customers for individual services, so if we have - for example - Grand Theft Auto V on Steam, by clicking the "play" button in the described application, we will have to log in to the Valve platform.
