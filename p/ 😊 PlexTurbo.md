By using the PlexTurbo utility, the user also extends the life of his SSD, as well as the speed of data access. After starting the computer, all programs that were turned on before the system was shut down will be automatically pre-loaded, which will save a lot of time in case you would like to restart them.  
 
 PlexTurbo supports the following SSD models: M6e / M6e Black Edition, M6e M.2 2280, M6 PRO, M6S and M6V. Depending on the device, the application uses up to 16 GB of RAM memory buffer.
