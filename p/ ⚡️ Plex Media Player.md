> After building your own multimedia library with the Plex Media Server tool, you would have to have a client with a convenient access. Here comes the help of Plex Media Player, which along with the release of version 1.2 has become a free application. Thanks to it, we will gain access to our resources from the entire network.

Plex Media Player consists of two interfaces. The first one, which is automatically available after entering the window mode, enables convenient access to browsing and multimedia management. The second one, which is launched in full-screen mode, is primarily a media player. The interface was created for both small laptop screens and large TV screens.
 
 The library is presented in the form of a transparent interface. When providing the right amount of data, we get large graphics and detailed information describing the file. Navigating the program is convenient, although it requires a few habits. Not all options are available on the screen, sometimes you need to make the right gesture to access even the additional options.
