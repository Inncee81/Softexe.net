PrivateWin10 provides a simple but complete interface for changing privacy settings. Advanced options have been collected in a simple and legible window. The program also provides the ability to block access to files and registry keys, although Windows 10 does not have particularly good settings that will provide full control over it. 
 
 
 In addition, PrivateWin10 can be used as a frontend to the Windows 10 firewall. Firewall settings allow you to block programs from sending our data and telemetry to the outside. 
 
 The program is available for free, along with the source code. The license, however, sets the conditions for creating your own compilations and redistribution.
