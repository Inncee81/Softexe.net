After installing the add-on, you can access the advanced settings from the level of two places. The first is to go to the list of add-ons, and then click the Options button next to Pale Moon Commander. The second method is to select the Tools option from the menu bar (on the Windows platform it is hidden, you can discover it by pressing the ALT button), and then go to the Advanced Options position. All advanced options have been arranged in groups and subgroups to make them easier to find.
 
 The first tab is for display. We will configure 2D acceleration settings, anti-aliased edges for 3D graphics, type rendering and smoothing, as well as color profiles. The second tab offers network settings: it allows you to control the IPv6 protocol, set up DNS buffers, and automatically append the start and end of addresses. We will also find here the Pipelining (Pipelining), which can allow faster loading of websites, as well as settings related to the operation of the SPDY protocol.
 
 The third tab concerns performance. Here you can find configuration options for the JavaScript engine, among others the choice of its engine, and the total shutdown of JS. We can manage the garbage collector, and also configure the browser cache size, both disk and stored in the main memory. With the addition in a few seconds we will be able to enable its compression. The next tab contains user interface settings. In subgroups, we find, among others function of highlighting domains, removing information about the protocol from the address bar, automatic address completion, as well as controlling the screen mode both manually activated and initiated by applications written in HTML5. One of the groups enables card management: we can quickly turn off the animation effect that accompanies closing them,
 
 The penultimate tab is for security-related functions. Here we can control the behavior and permissions of JavaScript and scripts contained on the pages, eg change of image attributes, permission to close windows, blocking mouse buttons or the closing button, and browser bars. Thanks to this group, we will also configure SSL settings by selecting the lowest and the highest supported protocol (eg opting only for TLS), blocking scripts that are not sent encrypted channel, as well as forcing such connections. Advanced users can even be tempted to manually control enabled and disabled algorithms and protocols that are supported for encrypted transmissions.
 
 The last of the tabs allows you to disable the browser built in Firefox PDF files, set the limit of space for HTML5 Local Storage, and reset the settings to the default. The add-on unfortunately does not offer a Polish language version, but for advanced users who want to specify the Firefox settings accurately, this should not be a problem.
