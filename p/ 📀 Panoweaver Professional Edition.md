The program offers the possibility of creating spherical, cylindrical and cube-shaped panoramas. The program has been armed with very good quality algorithms matching images, also in many rows, and the possibility of "manual stitching".
 
 You can use RAW files from digital cameras and photos taken with wide-angle lenses (also "fish-eye") to create a panorama. In addition, this edition of the program allows you to work with 16-bit images and add to the panorama of music and buttons: send, play music, print and the like. The project can be saved for further editing or exported to Flash, Shockwave, QuickTime, auto-launching CD, Java Applet or publisher-designed program, Easypano Company, Easypano Virtual Tour. The panorama loading screen in Flash and Shockwave formats can be customized to suit your needs.
