Platinum Hide IP is a small application to hide your real IP address and replace it with dummy to protect the user while using the network.

Thanks to the described program, we will increase security while viewing websites, protecting your private data, and also make our activity impossible to detect (therefore, no personalized ads will appear on our screen). 
 
 Platinum Hide IP also offers the possibility of using online forums blocked in the user's geographical region (for example, about music not available in a given location due to the applicable copyright laws). Thanks to this tool, we will also send anonymous e-mails via any e-mail service, such as Gmail or Hotmail.
 
 Platinum Hide IP is very easy to use. After launching the main application window, we can immediately generate a fictitious IP address or choose one of many available regions (including the United States and the United Kingdom). The application also allows you to choose web browsers with which to work - by default it is compatible with Opera, Firefox and Chrome.
