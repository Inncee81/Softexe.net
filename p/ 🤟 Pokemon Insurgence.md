For Pokemon Insurgence, Pokemon enthusiasts have developed a completely new plot, a previously inaccessible location for exploration (Torren), a full-fledged combat system, non-standard evolutions of the title creatures and the possibility of trading via the Internet.
 
 The whole was constructed in such a way that it would be accessible to both veterans and people who are just beginning their adventure with Pok√©mon. There are three different levels of difficulty at your disposal.
 
 Pokemon Insurgence offers an uncomplicated two-dimensional graphic design. During the game, we not only visit the world, but also talk to the characters we meet, collect creatures (you can catch as many as 722 original Pokemon from 1 to 6 generations) and take part in encounters with enemies. In addition, we also need to improve our secret base.
 
 Pokemon Insurgence contains a lot of play modes, such as eg Nuzlocke Mode or Randomizer. Players can try their hand at standard gameplay and numerous challenges.
