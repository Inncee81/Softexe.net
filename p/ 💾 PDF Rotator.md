Using the PDF Rotator is a hassle free. All you need to do is select the file, specify how to rotate the document (or a fragment of it, before setting the page range), the place of recording and click the appropriate button to start the operation. Files saved in PDF format can be rotated by 90 clockwise or in the opposite direction, and also by 180 degrees when the document is displayed upside down.
 
 PDF Rotator also includes the option of rotating proprietary files and a batch mode that allows you to rotate even more than 1000 documents at the same time. Interestingly, when you rotate multiple files, the user does not have to track the progress - he can use the sound signal option, which will inform him when the process is successfully carried out.
