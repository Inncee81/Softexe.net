However, the functionality of the program does not stop there, as Powder Player also enables playback of materials made available via YouTube, adding link magnet, and - as already mentioned - standard torrent files. With this tool you can also run VLC compliant videos. Subtitles for individual materials will be automatically downloaded from the OpenSubtitles website.
 
 Powder Player also supports the ability to send images to a variety of devices, including primarily those that support Chromecast, Airplay and DLNA technologies, but not only because this option can also be used on browsers (other computers, tablets, smartphones). 
 
 Powder Player provides a lot of configuration options, thanks to which we will determine the speed of downloading data, the path to which you download content from the BitTorrent network, the preferred image quality, the color of subtitles in movies, and many other additional settings.
