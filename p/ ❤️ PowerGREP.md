PowerGREP is a tool used to search for files saved on your computer's hard drive or on the network. It is definitely easier to use than most other such applications for Windows.

With this program, the user can quickly find the necessary files, folders, archives, Microsoft Word documents, Microsoft Excel sheets, Lotus 1-2-3 and Quattro Pro, files saved in PDF format, as well as OpenOffice office suite documents. Of course, this is not all - the application is great at finding other content placed on the hard disk or other data stores.
 
 PowerGREP does not require the user to know the full name of the file they are looking for - just enter parts of the phrase, and the program will certainly manage to reach the document you need. By using one or several regular expressions, you can search and exchange desired phrases, which makes it easier to manage web pages, source codes, reports, etc. You can also collect statistical data and retrieve necessary information from log files and large data sets.
 
 It is worth adding that PowerGREP contains a built-in text and binary file editor. Noteworthy is compatibility with regular expressions Perl, Java and .NET, extensive support for text coding: Windows and DOS code pages, Unicode, ISO-8859, ECBDIC, KOI8, etc. There is also the option of viewing and moving files to and from the ZIP archive.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 15 days.
