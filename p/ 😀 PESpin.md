```sh
Free, small tool that allows you to compress and secure EXE files before editing using such programs as Restorator Resource Editor or PE Explorer. PESpin compresses the full executable code, data and resources, providing protection against patching or disassembling the program. The libraries used to compress the resources were borrowed from the aPlib code created by Joergen Ibsen.
