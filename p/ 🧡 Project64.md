The emulator supports both the ability to control using the gamepad and the keyboard, regardless of whether we play only with artificial intelligence or with other players (multiplayer supports up to four users at the same time). It is worth mentioning that Project64 allows you to configure the controller by assigning appropriate actions to selected buttons.
 
 Project64 should not cause any problems during use. The program does not require using the BIOS and is equipped with the most useful functions, such as the aforementioned multiplayer mode and the ability to change the aspect ratio of the image without clipping, which allows you to adjust the display to the size of the screen.
