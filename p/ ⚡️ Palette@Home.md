Palette @ Home is a powerful tool that allows us to design any interior, or even the whole apartment or house.

After starting the program, choose one of three available profiles, which we must download to get started. The first step is to determine the shape and size of the room (we choose not only the height and length, but also the thickness of individual walls). Only then do we decorate the walls and then place various objects. We can design our work in two (placing doors, windows, furniture and accessories) and three dimensions (finishing walls, floor and ceiling).
 
 Palette @ Home has been designed so as not to cause trouble even for less experienced users who want to design the interior of the living room, kitchen, bathroom or manage the space in the office. Using the application is extremely intuitive (the "drag and drop" function makes it easier to arrange subsequent objects in a given room), and individual options available at your fingertips.
 
 If necessary, Palette @ Home allows you to use the built-in help system, thanks to which we will learn more about the specific functions included in the program.
