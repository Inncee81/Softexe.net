The program must be installed and configured on any NAS or DiskStation. Then, we can play any movies, music or even browse photos outside the home without any problems or wherever we are. Just connect to the internet to connect to our home server. 
 
 
 It is worth noting that we do not have to download movies or other multimedia entirely - the server makes it available and streams it. The application is characterized by a user-friendly user interface, which was created in such a way that it should not cause any trouble to anyone viewing and sharing media. 
 
 
 The program also includes a built-in and advanced manager for downloading information about a media file from the Internet, updating the entire database, and managing and organizing the entire media library. Using the program, we can share and watch movies in high quality HD and TV using a built-in, special player.
