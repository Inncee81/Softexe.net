The program protects user passwords using the Twofish algorithm (created by Schneier), and its security has been thoroughly checked by Counterpane Labs. The passwords can be stored either in one database or in many databases for specific applications. The bases can of course be transferred between systems, they are encrypted with a key generated from the main password (which is nowhere stored in the program). After opening the database, the login-password pairs in it can be copied to the clipboard. You can also use the automatic filling of web forms. For the willing, the password protection function for the hardware key YubiKey has been made available.
 
 The manager is available for free, under the free license Artistic License 2.0. Windows users can download the stable version, Linux owners must use the beta version for now (which works without any noticeable defects).
