In a nutshell, the method of organizing time is based on a few simple rules. At the beginning, we create a simple list of things to do, and then we focus on its implementation for 25 minutes. After this time we will take a 5-minute break and we will go back to the classes from the list. After 4 so-called Pomodoro (or repetitions) we have one longer break. It is essential that during the work on the tasks, turn off all "scatterers" and focus maximally on the action.
 
 Pomotroid is an application that was created to measure time, which should be spent on work or performing daily duties. It can signal to the user that 25 minutes has passed and he should rest. Notifications may take the form of on-screen speech bubbles and / or audio signals.
 
 The Pomotroid application was created based on Electron technology, offers a nice interface and is available for all the most popular system platforms.
