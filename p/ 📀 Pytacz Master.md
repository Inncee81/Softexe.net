After installation, sample tests are available, but the main purpose of the program is the ability to create your own using the Test Editor from the material that we need to learn, for example, for a kart. The learning of longer tests can be broken down into several stages (eg 20 words a day).
 
 In order to fix the material, the program will offer a replay on the second day, then after 3 days, after a week and after 3 weeks.
