When you start working with Praat, you can load any sound file (stereo or mono) saved on your computer's hard drive or record it using a microphone and built-in tools. It is important, however, that the file size should not exceed 2 gigabytes and last no more than 3 hours.
 
 Praat allows not only speech analysis in any sound file (eg checking the key, intensity, signal deviations, bends, vibrations and pauses), but also allows speech synthesis based on key tones, controls and intensities, and offers many other possibilities. With the help of the described program, you can edit audio files, trim selected parts, move or copy them, and even combine several recordings. 
 
 It is worth noting that among the formats of sound files supported by Praat we find mainly: WAV, MP3, AIFF, AIFC, FLAC, NeXT / Sun .au and NIST. Progam also supports various text and graphic files.
 
 The tool was designed for scientific purposes and requires a lot of knowledge on the part of the user. The creators, however, encourage novice users to read the various tips available on the official Praata website. For many, it may also be difficult to have an intuitive and user-friendly user interface.
