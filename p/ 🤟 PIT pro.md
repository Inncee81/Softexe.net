With it, it is possible to fill out the PIT-28, PIT-36, PIT-36L, PIT-37, PIT-38, PIT-39 forms together with the PIT attachments: / B, / D, / 2K, / M, / ZG, 28 / A, 28 / B, / 0, ZAP-3. The application can be successfully used for settlements of more than one taxpayer.
 
 The PIT pro application is targeted at both beginners as well as more polite users. It allows you to manually fill in individual fields of the form or use a special wizard that takes you step-by-step through the settlement process.
 
 In addition, the user is given the option to fill in the tax form almost automatically. All you need to do is transfer the data from your PIT-11 printing to the program.
 
 PIT pro allows you to save your completed tax returns within the program, and also allows you to print them and submit them electronically at the indicated Tax Office. 
 
 Attention! 
 The program does not allow free selection and transfer of 1% personal income tax to a selected public benefit organization.
