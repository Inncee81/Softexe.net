Partition Logic is a small utility for managing computer hard disk partitions. With its help, you can create, delete, erase, format, defragment, resize, copy and move partitions by editing their attributes. Partition Logic runs on the Visopsys operating system, boots from a CD, USB drive or floppy disk, functioning as a stand-alone, independent system.
