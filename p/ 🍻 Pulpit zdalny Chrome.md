The Chrome Remote Desktop is one of the most powerful enhancements for Google Chrome that introduces features in the browser that allow remote computer control.

The tool allows the user to connect to any computer via the Internet and its remote control, and on the contrary, securely share your computer with a selected person. Thanks to it, we can fix minor failures without physical contact with the device or carry out various types of training, etc. Chrome Remote Desktop gives us access to all files or applications installed on a remote computer.
 
 The huge advantage of the described extension is simple operation and no need for configuration. The Chrome remote desktop is ready for operation right after installing and running. All we need to do is choose a working mode - sharing your own computer or connecting with another one.
 
 Connections are implemented in the same way as in the case of TeamViewer through unique identifiers generated by the plugin.
