```sh
PCI-Z is a simple information application that displays details about PCI expansion cards installed in the computer and other elements of the motherboard (also newly installed ones that have not yet been recognized). In practice, it includes PCI-Express cards, PCI-X, motherboard controllers (sound cards, network cards, SATA interfaces, etc.). In addition, the program displays basic data about the computer: its name, currently logged in user, installed processor, the amount of available operating memory and the version of the operating system.

Among the displayed data we find, among others, the name of the manufacturer of the equipment, specific device symbols, type and sub-category, and status. We will learn from him, first of all, whether the devices have been properly configured and whether newer drivers are required. If so, we can search them directly from the application using the options in the context menu, but in practice it consists of automatically generating a query to Google search engine and displaying a list of all results in the default browser. The final selection of the appropriate driver and its download and installation will be the responsibility of the user.
 
 A convenient addition can be an option to export data in the form of a report (in TXT, CSV or JSON format) and the option of sending a statement by e-mail, although in this case the configuration of the account from which the message will be sent was unnecessarily complicated to several steps in separate windows. For this reason, although it is a simple operation, in practice it seems to be too time-consuming.
