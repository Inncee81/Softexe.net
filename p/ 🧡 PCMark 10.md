PCMark 10 is another version of a very popular application used for performance tests (benchmarks).

Although the described tool is very often used to check the performance of computer games, in fact PCMark 10 can also be used for other applications in testing our PC for operation in a specific environment (eg we will check the performance of the operating system itself, individual subassemblies or selected applications). 
 
 It would seem that, therefore, the program is addressed to experienced recipients, but it is really characterized by simplicity of operation, so the support for PCMark 10 will also be handled by novices. The tool does not require complicated configuration before commissioning. One click is enough to start the benchmark.
 
 PCMark 10 is also characterized by the speed of action (according to the manufacturer's information benchmark results can be obtained twice as fast as in the case of PCMark 8) and comfort of work (the application does not require dialing between the accelerated and conventional comparative test).
