Pidgin allows simultaneous login to multiple accounts of different networks, so you do not have to run a separate program for each network. The messenger supports an impressive number of networks, including AIM, ICQ, Jabber, MSN Messenger, Yahoo !, Bonjour, Gadu-Gadu, IRC, Novell GroupWise Messenger, QQ, Lotus Sametime, SILC, SIMPLE and Zephyr. The application includes support for many additional functions (in addition to text chat), including spell checking, file transfer, absence messages and posting notifications.
 
 The program also has a rich set of notifications about the news or availability of a given contact, as well as support for a large number of various plugins.
