The program itself has been equipped with a clear and legible graphical interface, which can be handled well not on the computer but also on the phone or tablet. It is characterized by fast and smooth operation, allowing comfortable application work even on older mobile devices. Importantly, the application uses OSM maps, very popular all over the world, which are created by their users, which ensures us that maps will always be up to date and using them we will not land in the "honest field".
 
 The Navigator Free PC software offers navigation functions to a user-defined point with the option of dynamic route change after descending from the designated one. We have the ability to define the type of route (the fastest, the shortest, etc.), adding intermediate points through which we would like to go, as well as tracking information such as updated route length, travel time, etc. The application has simple but aesthetic and clear visualizations of routes , access to information about POIs and locations where speed cameras can be found. A useful option is to back up the settings, allowing you to transfer individual program configurations between different devices.
 
 The creator also provides a commercial version of PC Navigator, which, in addition to the aforementioned functions of the free version offers, among others vehicle tracking options. More information about it can be found on the official website of the project .
