Sometimes we have multi-page PDF documents, the weight of which makes it impossible to send them by e-mail. In this situation, it is worth using PDF Compressor to resize the text file.
 
 PDF Compressor only requires the addition of a specific document by clicking the green plus icon, specifying its path on the hard disk and selecting the location to save the target file. After doing this, you can choose whether the source file is a scan or a document created on your computer. There is also an option to define the level of compression, and in some cases you can also change the DPI.
 
 It is worth mentioning that in addition to the function of converting individual documents, PDF Compressor also offers a batch mode, thanks to which we will reduce the size of many files in a short time.
