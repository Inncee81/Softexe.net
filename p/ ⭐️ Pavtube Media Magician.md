Just like competitive programs designed for beginner users, in this case the work with the application is based on the multimedia library and a special timeline. After loading all video materials (or recording via webcam), they should be placed using the drag-and-drop method on the mentioned timeline. The user has at his disposal tools allowing to cut and connect individual clips conveniently, apply effects to them, and improve their quality by using blur / sharpen filters, aging and correction of basic image attributes (brightness, contrast, saturation, etc.).
 
 Pavtube Media Magician allows you to use modern graphics technology nVidia and AMD to speed up video processing. The tool supports the following output formats TS, MTS, M2TS, TP, TRP, AVI, MP4, MPG, MPEG, 3GP, 3G2, WMV, ASF, RM, RMVB, DAT, MOV, QT, FLV, F4V, MKV, NUT, H .264, NSV, VOB, TOD and TIVIO, giving the opportunity to export to most of these formats, as well as files compatible with Android mobile devices, iPad / iPhone / Apple TV, stationary DVD players, PSP / PS3 / Xbox 360 consoles and Avid Studio software, Adobe Premiere, Sony Vegas, Adobe After Effect, Cyberlink PowerDirector and Pinnacle Studio.
