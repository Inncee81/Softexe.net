The tool allows you to play selected programs on a personal computer and offers the function of streaming the image to the TV screen using a wireless connection. Just connect the TV to the device that allows you to stream the image, such as Chromecast, Roku, PlayStation, Xbox and Wii.
 
 PlayOn is characterized by a modern, user-friendly interface. From the main application window, we have access to your favorite TV channels and movies. The tool offers the opportunity to watch programs and series broadcast by, among others, FOX, ESPN, Cartoon Network, CNN and SyFy, and also allows you to read the content shared on YouTube, Netflix and Hulu.
 
 PlayOn allows you to record any material shared on TV or the Internet by using just one click (both on the computer and using the application installed on a mobile device to start recording in our absence at home) or to automate this task. You can register both individual episodes and whole seasons of selected series in this way. The program will remember about recording the next episode when it will be broadcast on TV.
 
 Movies, series and programs recorded with PlayOn can be played with the omission of advertisements - this saves a lot of time, taking into account the fact that some of the advertising blocks last sometimes more than 10 minutes. 
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 14 days.
