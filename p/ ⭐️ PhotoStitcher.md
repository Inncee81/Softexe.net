> PhotoStitcher is a graphic program, thanks to which we will create a panoramic photo by automatically joining three separate photographs. You do not need to have a wide-angle lens to show the beauty of a place in a wide image - just a simple camera.

The tool is extremely easy to use and does not require any specialist knowledge or professional skills - just select photos and click "stich" to combine them into one. PhotoStitcher easily combines overlapping photos stored in different resolutions, taken from a different angle, and even in a different perspective, quickly preparing eye-catching panoramic photographs.
 
 PhotoStitcher will combine several photos into one, regardless of what will be found on them - they can be beautiful landscapes (eg sea, mountains), monumental churches or other places that we were able to capture in a photo, eg during a trip. All you have to do is make sure that each of the photos you're going to create a panorama with is another 30-50 percent.
