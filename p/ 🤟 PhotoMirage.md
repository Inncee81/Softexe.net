> PhotoMirage is a graphic program that allows you to easily animate portions of photos. By marking fragments that should move and which should stay motionless, the program allows you to revive waterfalls, clouds, flames, give artistic or psychedelic effects to photos.

It is relatively easy to use the program, but you need to familiarize yourself with the three basic tools. The mask (tint icon) allows us to cover fragments of the image that will not be movable. We can control the hardness and size of the brush and enlarge the image, so we can quite accurately mark the areas of the pictures. 
 
 
 The direction of movement is determined by arrows, whose position, length and direction can be changed at any time. Points and fragments that are to remain in place regardless of the animated area are marked with anchors (squares). In this way, we will avoid, for example, stretching the boundary of photos, curving the horizon, splitting lines and similar undesirable effects. Elements that determine the shape of the animation can also be viewed on separate layers, grouped and moved. PhotoMirage also has a simple tool for improving the color and contrast of photos. 
 
 
 Animation can be previewed and improved at any time. When we're happy with the effect, we can save the animation as a movie or animated GIF. Animated images can also be shared on social media directly from the program. 
 
 
 The trial version of the program works without restrictions for 15 days.
