> PlayStatic is a tool for computers with the Windows 10 operating system that allows you to automate various operations performed during daily work.

If our duties are to perform the same tasks on a regular basis using the keyboard and mouse, it can become extremely tedious over time. However, PlayStatic, an easy-to-use program that can be easily described as a macro recorder, comes with the help. In addition, the tool can automatically run Windows, but this option is not particularly recommended.
 
 From the main PlayStatic window you get access to four tabs. We can add tasks in manual mode or - as already mentioned - register operations performed on a computer for later retrieval. The application interface is extremely transparent, thanks to which less experienced users will also be able to handle it.
