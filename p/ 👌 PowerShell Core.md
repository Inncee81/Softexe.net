PowerShell Core is an open, cross-platform command interpreter developed by Microsoft. The program is so extensive that it will work as an automation system and command line, adapted to work with structured data (JSON, CSV, XML and others), REST API and object models. The interpreter is accompanied by the scripting language and its own intuitive commands (Cmdlets).
