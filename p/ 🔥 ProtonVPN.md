ProtonVPN is a customer of a free VPN service, thanks to which we can hide your location and bypass geo-blockades. Behind ProtonVPN stands the same Swiss group that develops ProtonMail, a secure postal service.

To log in to ProtonVPN we need a Proton account, which can be set up by clicking the button in the welcome window. In the sidebar in the main window you can see a list of all available locations. Just click one of the items and click "Connect" to get the connection.
 
 You can also check your location on the map on the right side of the map. The ProtonVPN client also allows you to create profiles, thanks to which the user can save his configurations (country, server) and assign its name and color.
 
 In the program settings you will find only the basic possibilities: you can decide whether the program should be run with Windows, enable automatic connection and review the account settings.
 
 After the first start-up, the user may use the 7-day trial period of the Plus account. After this time, the account goes to the free version, which can be used only from three locations.
