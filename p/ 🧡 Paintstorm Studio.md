Despite the huge number of options - the same ones associated with different types of brushes and their customization can be counted in hundreds - the program is quite intuitive to use and does not require reading the user manual to become familiar with it. As mentioned above, there are quite a lot of functions, many of them related to various brushes, which can be further modified to better reflect the individual style of the user.
 
 The advantage of Paintstorm Studio is the Polish language version and an interface that can be personalized under each other, setting, among other things, the color scheme or the transparency of panels and windows. The application allows you to work on any number of layers, supports keyboard shortcuts and offers very rich options related to the selection and mixing of colors, and even the ability to create your own painting palette.
 
 Attention!
 
 The manufacturer does not recommend running the program on computers without a dedicated graphics card.
 In the trial version of the program, some functions may not be available.
