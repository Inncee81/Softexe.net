```sh
Prysm Break is an unusual two-dimensional platformer in which vivid colors predominate and an interesting element appears in the form of parallel routes that should be traveled by moving a drop of paint.

Generally, the game is quite minimalistic and consists in passing subsequent levels by overcoming obstacles (jumping). The more difficult the level, the more elements of parallel routes: a white drop of paint breaks into other colors, which overcome various fragments, while controlling all the colors at the same time.
 
 In the game you can also count on an interesting sound setting - a bit mysterious, and certainly calming. Both it and sound effects can be disabled in the settings if necessary. The game can be played in full-screen mode.
