Thanks to this program, we will be able to maintain anonymity during everyday use of the network. This option may be useful when you do not want our activity on the internet to be tracked, and the ads displayed on individual pages personalized based on the user's browsing history.
 
 It is worth noting that the Penguin Proxy works on a slightly different basis than standard tools of this type. Yes, the application encrypts user traffic on the network, but not only using the manufacturer's servers, but also other Penguin Proxy users. This can affect both the speed of downloading and sending data by the person using the program.
 
 It should also be noted that the program only supports HTTP traffic (web browser). It does not work with the OpenVPN, SOCKS, Bittorrent and SMPTP protocols.
