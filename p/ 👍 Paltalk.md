Following other applications of this type, we get here the possibility of sending text messages, conducting voice calls or video conferencing. Paltalk includes the file sharing function, so we do not need to install an additional tool if we want to send various documents, photos or videos. There is also an option to place materials from YouTube or SoundCloud sites in the conversation window.
 
 The tool not only allows you to chat with selected people, but also allows you to search for chat rooms (you can freely view them or use the included search engine). The database contains over 5,000 public rooms to which we can join to meet new people.
 
 Attention!
 Paltalk requires the creation of a free user account, to which we must log in to start using the application.
