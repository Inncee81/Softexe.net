Precise CPU Stress presents the results of tests in real time in the form of a clear graph (a legend is available after pressing the appropriate button located in the upper part of the program window), and if necessary, we can save the measurements as a screenshot.
 
 Precise CPU Stress allows you to run the CPU test easily and quickly using the "start CPU" button, which can of course be stopped using the "stop CPU" function. Other buttons are also available: "exit", "exit menu" and "esc". The latter allows you to stop all tests immediately, close open windows and disable running programs.
 
 When it comes to operating memory, the test starts here with the use of the "start RAM" function. Then a special "Memory Bomb" window will appear on the screen, which launches the load test based on the settings defined by the RAM Stress Level. In the context menu "Memory Bomb" we will increase the memory load by another 5 percent (up to 95 percent maximum).
