> 0patch is a tool that dynamically blocks 0-day vulnerabilities in software that has not yet received official patches from the manufacturer.

After starting, the agent receives a list of so-called Acros Security server micro-cards that are automatically included in the computer's memory, preventing attackers from using known exploits.
 Thanks to the speed of micro-sheet delivery, 0patch is able to secure the software much faster than its producers. And when the official patch is released, the micro-chip is simply turned off. We can, of course, manually control micro-cards, excluding those we do not want.
 Note: the program requires registration, i.e. providing your e-mail address.
