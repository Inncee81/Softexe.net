VideoInspector is a small and very easy to use program providing detailed information about the selected video file. Among them, we can find data about the audio and video codecs and filters required for its reproduction.

The tool can be used successfully to identify codecs that are required to play a given video material. In addition to the detection of missing components, VideoInspector also allows you to download them from the Internet. 
 
 In addition, the application provides information about the video file resolution, FPS values, bitrate, image quality factor, audio channel amount and Sample Rate. VideoInspector perfectly copes with audio / video containers: AVI, Matroska, MPEG I, MPEG II and QuickTime.
 
 Attention!
 
 The installation wizard offers the user to install additional components. They are not required to run the program and we do not recommend installing them.
