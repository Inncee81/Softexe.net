> VeraCrypt has been developed for a long time, an advanced tool for data encryption, which was created by the French based on the popular TrueCrypta. There are not many changes to the original, but they are significant and increase the security level of the encrypted data.

Like the progenitor, VeraCrypt allows both encryption of entire disks, their partitions and portable USB disks (pendrives), as well as the creation of virtual encrypted disks (also hidden) of a certain capacity - in both cases secured by a password against unauthorized access. Encryption is carried out using very strong encryption algorithms AES-256, Serpent and Twofish. It is also possible to cascade encryption, i.e. data encryption in turn with several algorithms.
 
 How to encrypt the VeraCrypt drive? We explain this step by step in our guide .
 The developers boast that their tool in the case of encrypting the system partition using PBKDF2-RIPEMD16 performs 327661 iterations, not 1000 as in TrueCrypt. Going further, on the official website of the project we find information that for standard data containers and other partitions, TrueCrypt performs 2000 iterations, and VeraCrypt uses them 655331 for RIPEMD160 and 500000 for SHA-2 and Whirlpool, which has a significant impact on protecting encrypted data, e.g. against brute-force attacks.
 
 Importantly, the increased level of security does not affect the speed of data encryption / decryption. It may, however, extend the time of mounting such a container in the program. It is worth noting that although VeraCrypt is based on TrueCrypt, both programs use partitions in different formats that are not compatible with each other.
