> VisualCAM is software for computer-aided manufacturing. The program allows you to develop a method of machining a given object on specific machines and generate an NC code. The package consists of several modules sold separately: VisualMILL for milling machines, VisualTURN for working with lathes and other rotating tools, VisualNEST for planning the optimal use of material and VisualART for converting shapes into shapes suitable for production.

VisualCAM supports 3-, 4- and 5-axis milling machines and lathes, which in combination with a large base of postprocessors allows you to generate code for almost any machine. The program also has an extensive database of tools with precisely specified parameters, which allows you to adjust the production process.
 
 
 The program's operation is very convenient thanks to a browser with a project tree, similar to that found in many CAD programs. In separate tabs, the user can view blanks, tools and operations performed while machining parts. The tool path editor also allows you to fine-tune the details manually.
 
 
 VisualCAM reads most of the solid and surface model formats used in the industry, as well as the native format of SolidWorks. VisualART also reads raster graphics.
