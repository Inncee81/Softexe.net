The program has been prepared for clients of architectural offices, who will be able to view the effects of works, even though they do not have the full version of the program. The browser is based on the full version of Vectorworks, but has limitations in accessing the tool palettes. The program allows you to use the measurements and navigation as well as the preview rendering settings. 
 
 
 The program allows you to view projects prepared in Vectorworks from version 9 to 2017.
