In order to use VPN HUB on the desktop, you must have an account and premium version of the service, which can be done via the mobile application, by paying a subscription. In the Android and iOS applications, you can also run a free trial period and test the client on the desktop. By the way, we get access to the list of "output" servers in different countries - the free version for mobile devices is available only in the USA.
 
 Traffic directed by the VPN is encrypted, and the original IP address of the computer is hidden from the services we connect to. Thanks to this, you can protect data when connected to public hotspots, as well as gain access to blocked content, bypassing censorship and geoblocks.
