Venmon is a fully free tool for monitoring the operation of a computer running Windows.
```

The tool in real time generates information about system memory as well as the processor, battery life, uptime and idle time, network traffic and drivers. At the same time, it should be noted that Venmon consumes very little CPU and memory resources, which in effect will even work on weaker devices (eg older laptops).
 
 Venmon can operate in a large window, but nothing prevents you from using the minimalist version of the interface, thanks to which the mentioned data will be displayed on the desktop in a discreet way. 
 
 Importantly, Venmon is also available in a portable edition, which can be saved on a USB stick and run on any computer without installation.
