The free version of VRMark, the Basic Edition described here, includes access to a benchmark called the Orange Room, in which we will check our components for devices such as HTC Vice and Oculus Rift. VRMark also includes additional operating modes (eg DirectX 12 benchmark for VR), but they are available only in paid editions.
 
 After launching, you should wait a moment until VRMark Basic Edition displays information about our PC (speech about the operating system, your CPU and GPU). After performing the benchmark, the tool will generate a detailed report that will present the overall score, a text summary, as well as the average number of FPS (frames per second) displayed during testing, comparing them with the minimum requirements of VR goggles in this range.
 
 Interestingly, the application can be run not only in a traditional way, ie on a PC (for example before buying these VR devices), but also using the VR goggles (Experience Mode) that you have.
