The tool allows you to run over 200 supported operating systems - including different versions of Windows and Linux distributions. This solution allows you to test a selected system or new software on a computer in a specially isolated environment, without worrying about the potential consequences in the native system. At the same time, the environment running under VMware Player is characterized by much faster speed and efficiency compared to, for example, the Windows XP mode built into Windows 7. The program allows you to handle up to 8 processor cores and 32 GB RAM for each of the virtual machines. 
 
 Virtual systems running in the VMware Player can use CD / DVD drives, network interfaces, devices connected via USB and others. Mutual access to the network shares of the real and virtual computer as well as the transfer of files between the systems by drag-and-drop is a great convenience during work.Attention!
 
 The latest version (7.x) is available only for Windows 7/8. Users of older editions of Windows (XP / Vista) are encouraged to download the 6.0.4 edition available from the level of direct links (above the stars with the rating of the program).
 On the Virtual Machine Center page, you can download the Novell, RedHat, IBM, BEA, MySQL, Oracle and SpikeSource software configured for virtual machines.
