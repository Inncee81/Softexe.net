The program has been equipped with all the necessary functions that allow not only to capture and save the audio signal, but also to divide the recorded soundtrack into parts and to remove all unwanted sounds from it. For the user, apart from the audio recorder, there is a built-in editor for dividing the recording into individual tracks and a tool for "cleansing" the sound from all kinds of squeaks, noises and glitches.
 
 The advantage of VinylStudio is simple operation and rich functionality, which also includes the ability to configure many attributes of processed materials, automatically create albums based on user-defined data, burning processed tracks to CDs (supported compilation types are Audio CDs and CD or DVD media with MP3 files) and transferring recordings to portable players.
