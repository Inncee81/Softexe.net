Audio, video and graphics files can be used for editing in many popular formats. In addition, the program allows you to record images directly from a DV, VHS camera or a regular webcam. All loaded materials are placed on a list, from which we can freely move them and arrange them on the timeline (support for the drag-and-drop method). There is a set of simple transitions, effects as well as functions for adding signatures and reduction of basic image properties (brightness, contrast, etc.).
 
 The big advantage of VideoPad Video Editor Pro is support for many popular formats, thanks to which the effect of our work outside the playback on your computer can be viewed without any problems on a stationary DVD / HD-DVD / Blu-Ray player, iPod / iPhone devices, mobile phones and PSP consoles or eg . put on the pages of YouTube.List of supported input formats
