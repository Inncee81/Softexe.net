We are dealing here with a tool that supports vector files, thanks to which we will perform both basic and more advanced operations on various images. Vectr allows you to manipulate various objects (resizing, rotating, etc.), adding numerous effects, enriching your work using available tools, such as a pencil or a brush, as well as inserting text or various shapes.
 
 Vectr allows you to save images to SVG, PNG or JPG formats and import your graphics. We will not only be able to save our work on the hard disk of a computer or other media, but also print it and make it available on social networks (on Facebook or Twitter).
