Virtual DJ is a free version of advanced software for creating music by mixing different pieces, adding effects, samples and sound sources that can compete with professional mixing devices.

Virtual DJ has a rich, but very accessible user interface, simulating a mixer table - a DJ work tool. On the main screen, the program shows two players working in parallel on independent tracks, visualizations of individual sound channels, a database of available music with the possibility of convenient viewing and searching for materials. Instead of a browser, the user can enable panels for applying effects, controls for sound sources or recording options. In addition, we find here some useful additions, such as a processor activity monitor and a clock.
 
 Virtual DJ allows you to not only assemble music, but also video clips accompanying it. The program has a modest but sufficient library of visual effects and transitions. An interesting feature of the program is the ability to prepare material for karaoke events.
 
 Limitations of the free version
 Virtual DJ Home does not have some features that can be found in the paid Virtual DJ Pro. The free version is not able to play video clips in full screen, it does not support an external mixer or MIDI / HID controller and it is not possible to broadcast live music. In addition, support for skins and plug-ins in this version is limited.
