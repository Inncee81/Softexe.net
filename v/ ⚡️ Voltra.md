The creators paid attention to the smallest details. Even such an activity as adding new songs was dressed in a nice graphic design. The application plays all popular file formats - MP3, MP4, ACC, OGG, also supports lossless FLAC and WAV formats.
 
 Between the views we switch using the buttons placed on the top - the whole is clear and intuitive. We can browse the music library with the division into the name of the song, album or artist. We can also create your own playlists. In the settings, we decide on the main color - brown, orange, purple, blue, green or gray. We can also choose the main subject - light or dark.
 
 After installation, we are asked to set up an account. However, we do not need to do this if we do not want to use additional services. The creators offer the option of uploading a local music library to the cloud and synchronization between devices. This additional feature requires a premium subscription - $ 9.99 / month or $ 99.99 / year.
