Performing streams thanks to vMix can take place even in 4K quality, although many users will probably choose HD image, and sometimes - due to limitations - perhaps even in SD. The program is compatible with, among other things, DeckLink and Intensity Pro cards. It also allows the use of many audio devices (eg sound from sound card and DeckLink cards).
 
 vMix allows you to display one image or several screens (for example, you can place a demonstration of the selected application on one and the presenter on the other). The tool supports various webcams, so that viewers during the broadcast can see not only, for example, the gameplay of the chosen game, but also your reactions.
 
 The tool supports the most popular video file formats, including AVI, MP4, H264, MPEG-2, WMV and QuickTime, as well as sound files - MP3 and WAV. It also includes a built-in tool for mixing sound files, which allows you to easily manage sound sources, offering the ability to mute selected sound sources or to delay the sound source.
 
 vMix also allows you to enrich the transmission by using more than a dozen transition effects. With the right options, you can access your favorite effects very quickly to use them at the right time without having to look at the program settings. The user also has the option of color enhancement, de-interlacing, sharpening, zooming and rotating video during live broadcast.
 
 Interestingly, the management of vMix options can be done remotely using vMix Web Controller on touch screens (Surface, Android, Ipad) via the embedded web interface. You can create keyboard shortcuts to activate various options.
