> Visual Subst is a small tool designed to create virtual disks that refer to the most-preferred locations in the system. The program's operation is very simple, all you need to do is indicate the appropriate folder and assign one of the letters available in the alphabet, and automatically the system will display a new disk icon representing the given location. Visual Subst also allows you to mount virtual disks during system startup.
