VIPRE Advanced Security will minimize the risk of malware on your computer, protecting it against a variety of network threats, such as keyloggers, rootkits, Trojans and exploits. Not all such files will be detected by the antivirus program so fast that they can be safely removed before they start operating, which is why it is worth using an additional tool, which is VIPRE Advanced Security.
 
 VIPRE Advanced Security also filters spam, which means that there will be no additional ads or other unwanted content in our email inbox. This type of protection, just like the firewall and a number of other options, can be activated or deactivated at any moment with just one click.
 
 It is worth noting that VIPRE Advanced Security allows you to scan your hard drive to find viruses at any time, but it can also work according to a predetermined schedule. 
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
