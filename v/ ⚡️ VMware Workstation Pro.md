The tool also works very well with all kinds of devices and peripheries, including those connected to COM and USB ports. Both those using USB 1.1 and 2.0. The program included many facilities - one of them is even the possibility of free data transfer between the host and the virtual computer on the principle of the drag-and-drop method.
 
 Noteworthy is the fact that the application as one of the few, thanks to a small modification of the file of the selected virtual machine, allows you to support 3D acceleration.Attention!
 The trial version allows you to use the program for a period of 30 days.
