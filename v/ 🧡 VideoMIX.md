Thanks to the VideoMIX program, we will be able to connect several clips together, as well as delete unnecessary fragments in the indicated materials. The tool supports the most popular file formats (input and output), such as: AVI, MP4, MPG, MOV, MKV and others. Before saving the created movie, you can read its preview to make any necessary corrections (eg change the volume and speed of playback) or add transition effects.
 
 VideoMIX contains several settings that allow us to adjust the frame rate (from 12 to 60 FPS), as well as image resolution (from 256 to 144 to 1280 to 1080 pixels).
