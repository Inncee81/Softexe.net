Vue Pioneer is simple to use - the program has been designed so that the user is not worried about the perspective, lighting or shadows - the whole is implemented through convenient effects wizards, like generating the atmosphere. The free version of the basic Vue Pioneer is limited, but the program's capabilities can be increased using optional (paid) modules and additional facilities. A logo appears on the images rendered by Vie Pioneer (there is no typical watermark) that can be removed by purchasing the RenderUp module. Even in the basic, free version, the program offers great opportunities for people who are taking their first steps in 3D graphics.
