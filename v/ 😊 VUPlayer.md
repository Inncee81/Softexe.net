The application has been created with a strong emphasis on simplicity, which is why it offers mostly only the necessary functions for comfortable music playback. The main program window, apart from the navigation panel and playlist, contains a tree with the contents of the library and the area in which we will display, for example, an oscilloscope, spectrum analyzer or album cover.
 
 VUPlayer very well handles the playback of individual files, as well as containing thousands of playlist songs. It has support for keyboard shortcuts that will improve the player's operation, and also offers sound normalization functions (ReplayGain).
 
 The creator has made the application available in a standard form for installation, as well as in a portable (portable) form, which is ready for operation right after downloading.
