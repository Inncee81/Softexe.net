> Vectorworks is a comprehensive BIM software for designing architecture, landscapes and landscaping. The program allows you to carry out the entire process in one place, from sketching through models to documentation and customer renders.

The program allows you to model and create sketches, but its heart is BIM (Building Information Modeling), Vectorworks will also be useful in modeling the environment (SIM, Site Information Modeling). The tools we find here allow us to prepare physical and functional models of buildings and the surrounding space, as well as plans and project documentation. Models can be edited and analyzed from many angles, including improved irrigation of the terrain (new in the 2017 version) or construction details.
 
 Parametric objects allow to prepare a prototype of buildings with a given level of detail. Modeling of the environment allows to take into account also slopes, slopes and cliffs, shaded and sunny areas at a given time of the year or water flow. The zoning plan can be entered based on plans, satellite imagery or manually, based on dimensions. 
  
 
 When creating a geometry model, you can use an advanced modeling system that uses the body of the Parasolid modeler and NURBS surfaces (you can import from Rhino ). The interface of this part of the program is very intuitive and introduces various improvements, such as automatic recognition of work planes or attraction of solid edges. Modeled in different views, as in many 3D graphics programs, using high-quality preview and precise measurement.  
 
 The Vectorworks software enables team work and editing of the same project by several people. OBJ, STL, 3DS and SKP files ( SketchUp ) can be imported into projects . Users of other solutions, such as Revit , can send IFC files. Documentation can be exchanged in gbXML, DWG / DXF, Revit, PDF formats and many others. The library also has symbols, furniture models and materials provided by numerous producers from around the world.
 
 
 Vectorworks Designer also allows you to prepare a presentation. In rendering photorealistic building intakes, a Renderworks engine based on Cinema 4D is used . In the illustrations you can choose the right lighting, both inside and outside, using the extensive library of lights provided by the manufacturers. The wide possibilities of lighting scenes are also useful when designing sets and exhibitions. In addition, you can prepare interactive VR presentations or automatically convert technical illustrations to artistic sketches. 
 
 
 
 Vectorworks is available in several modules, with different possibilities, applications and prices:
 
 
 Basic: Design
 Architecture and Interiors
 Garden and landscape
 Spotlight (design of lighting, exhibitions and events, the only untranslated into Polish)
 sum of all modules named Studio
 
 
 The program requires a dedicated graphics card with OpenGL 3.0 and at least 4 GB of RAM.
 
 
 Software distribution is carried out by the Design Express company in Poland. All information and additional materials can be found on the Vectorworks.pl website . The form can carry out a demonstration of the program's possibilities and provides a free "Vectorworks Landmark-Fundamentals" guide by Agnieszka DÄ™bicka.
