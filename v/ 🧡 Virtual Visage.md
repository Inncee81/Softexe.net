The program gives the possibility of styling model photos, as well as loading photos and arranging your own face or nails. All elements available in the program are grouped into categories, among which we can find various types of objects, allowing stylization of the eyes, lips, adding facial hair, hats and caps, glasses, tattoos, etc. Each of them can be edited after being applied to the photo, which allows position and size of the object to the face.
 
 The finished project can be saved on disk or sent by e-mail to the address indicated. Unfortunately, this option is only available to users who have previously purchased a license. On the manufacturer's website you can find a set of additional elements for this, which are available for free download.
