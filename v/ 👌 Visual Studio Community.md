> Visual Studio Community 2017 is a simplified, but at the same time free version of the Microsoft Visual Studio Professional programming environment (IDE). The program is addressed to students, software developers in the spirit of open code and individual programmers.

Visual Studio is used to create desktop applications, universal for Modern UI, web applications using ASP.NET and Silverlight, and using the cloud. It also allows you to create programs for the Windows Phone, Android and iOS platforms. The code can be written in one of several default languages ​​supported in Visual Studio 2017, including: C #, Visual Basic, C ++, F # and JavaScript. The program is considered by many to be the highest-level programming environment
 
 Regarding the Professional edition , the program has been mostly impoverished in terms of options related to cooperation between programmers in the case of creating one project in several people. The benefits of a subscription, including additions to courses and technical assistance, will also be missing here.
