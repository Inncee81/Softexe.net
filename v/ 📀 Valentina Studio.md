Thanks to Valentine Studio, the user can create databases, deal with the administration of existing ones, and perform a number of other operations, such as editing entries (syntax highlighting, line numbering, automatic replenishment) or checking parameter properties. The program supports Valentina, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL and SQLite databases.
 
 Valentina Studio is characterized by a clear user interface that can work on multiple databases simultaneously. The list of current connections is available on the left side of the screen, while in the middle there are running databases (switching between them is done by clicking on the selected card, as in the web browser). If you want to quickly create a base, you can use one of the many available templates.
 
 It is worth mentioning the presence of the schematic editor, in which you can easily find all the necessary data with the possibility of editing them. However, a built-in search engine will undoubtedly be useful to find a selected project.
