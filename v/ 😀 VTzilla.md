The extension is a perfect complement to traditional antivirus programs, allowing the user to analyze selected websites and files using dozens of the most popular scanning engines (including such vendors as Symantec, Kaspersky, GData, ESET, Avira and many others).
 
 After installation, the plugin displays an additional bar in the browser window from which we will scan the selected URL. In addition, the appropriate option is also available when downloading files and from the context menu.
