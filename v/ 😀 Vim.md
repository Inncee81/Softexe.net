Vim distinguishes itself with an ascetic user interface that hides extended functionality. Vim allows, among others on: simultaneous editing of multiple files in separate windows (buffers), undoing to thousands of recently performed operations and moving back to the place in time in the life of the file. Another advantages are multi-chaos, support for syntax highlighting of both programming languages ​​and, for example, LaTeX, an extensive system of work automation with text using regular expressions.
 
 Despite its advantages and high efficiency that can be obtained when working with this program, it requires learning its function, it does not lead "by the hand" and is not recommended for novice computer users.Vim allows you to write texts from right to left (as in Arabic, Persian or Hebrew) and containing multi-byte characters - ie represented by more than one byte (such as in Chinese, Japanese or Korean). Vim also has commands that allow you to automatically respond to specific events (autocommands), eg to automatically unpack a compressed file. It is also possible to record the editing process in the form of macros. The program has an internal scripting language that allows you to easily add new functions.
