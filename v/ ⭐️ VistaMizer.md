VistaMizer is a tool for users of the Windows XP operating system that allows you to give it a Windows Vista look. It works well with people who want to work on an older version of "windows" with a modern interface.

Before using VistaMizer, you should know that you can install them not only as a simple application that is easy to remove at any time, but also an overlay for the Windows XP operating system. In the latter case, the changes can only be undone by reinstalling Windows XP on the hard disk. In the first it is possible to restore the system to an earlier state, because the program creates a restore point during configuration.
 
 VistaMizer only changes the appearance of windows XP windows, individual applications and system tools (including Internet Explorer, Windows Media Player, Notepad or Control Panel), therefore it does not introduce unique Windows Vista options, such as the Aero interface.
