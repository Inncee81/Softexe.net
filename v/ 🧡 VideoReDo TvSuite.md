Tools offered within the tool can be successfully used for basic video processing, and even preparing DVD media with videos recorded using a telephone or digital camera, eg during a holiday trip outside the city. VideoReDo TvSuite allows you to trim selected video files, save selected frames to a BMP file, create subsequent chapters of DVD-Video compilation, and synchronize the audio track with the image.
 
 The strong point of the program is the tools used to author the DVD. They allow you to create complete DVD media with movies without using external software. With their help, we will create a video compilation containing many chapters, we will generate a simple but aesthetic menu for our media and we will adapt its key elements. VideoReDo TvSuite supports PAL / NTSC standards, allows you to create compilations for one- and two-tier media, record them, save projects to an ISO file and perform DVD reauthorization (modification of the DVD-Video structure, IFO files).
 
 The list of formats supported by VideoReDo TvSuite includes DVR-MS, MOV, MPG, MPEG, MP4, MTS, M2TS, TS4, WTV, REC, TS, TP, TIVO, VOB and VRO.
