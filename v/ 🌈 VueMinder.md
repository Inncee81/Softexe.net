The program offers 2 display modes - full and mini. The first of these allows you to place a full calendar on the desktop, which can be managed without having to run the main program window. The second one, minimalist, only displays a calendar similar to that offered by other applications of this type. In both cases, the user can freely change the position and size of the calendar, as well as the level of its transparency.
 
 VueMinder has calendar and schedule functions that will remind the user about scheduled tasks. The application can be used as a tool for managing events, meetings, etc. Additions to the calendar, apart from information such as the start and end date of the event, location, categories and priority may also contain various attachments in the form of, for example, graphic files, sound files, etc. the advantage of the program is a large number of possible variants of reminders. In addition to the standard "balloons", VueMinder also allows alerts about upcoming events in the form of an e-mail or SMS. It is also possible to automatically synchronize with Google Calendar and share calendars with other people.
 
 The free version of the program has significant limitations compared to the paid editions (Pro and Ultimate), but the functionality offered by it does not differ in any way from other solutions of this type. A great advantage of VueMinder is the transparent and polished graphic interface and the ability to display the calendar directly on the Windows desktop.
