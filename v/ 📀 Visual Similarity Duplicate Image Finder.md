Visual Similarity Duplicate Image Finder &nbsp;- the main purpose of the program is to quickly search for identical or similar image files. The application uses advanced algorithms for comparison of graphic images. Even if graphic files have different formats (gif, png, jpg, bmp ...) and different color depths - the program is still able to compare them, and you can set the "similarity" attribute as a percentage (see the screenshot of the program and understand ).

After the process of comparing graphic files, the program will provide you with detailed information about identical files and provide you with the opportunity to remove duplicate (s) with a simple mouse click.
