Sometimes, there is a situation where we can not edit the selected PDF, because it has been protected by the owner. It is impossible not only to edit, but also to print, select text or copy selected fragments of text to the clipboard. With the help comes then, the VeryPDF PDF Password Remover, which offers the ability to lift these limitations.
 
 VeryPDF PDF Password Remover copes very well with the removal of the so-called owner password (40 and 128-bit access passwords encrypted using AES), i.e. security imposed by the owner of the document (next to it the user can also meet the user password, but in this case, of course, the password defined by the user of the document preventing even opening the PDF -and).
 
 Noteworthy is the highly transparent interface PDF Password Remover, as well as the ease of use - the program uses not only the option of adding files using Windows Explorer, but also by using the drag-and-drop technique.
