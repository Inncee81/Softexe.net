> Microsoft Visual C ++ 2017 Redistributable is the latest set of libraries that allows running many applications created using Microsoft's programming tools in Windows.

These libraries are needed so that an application written using Visual C ++ 2017 can be launched on a user's system in which Microsoft's programming tools are not present. The lack of the described library is most often manifested by an error message saying that the application can not find the appropriate DLL files. Some programs already check during installation that VC ++ libraries are present in the system and offer their automatic installation. Often, however, you should do it yourself.
 
 Once installed, VC ++ libraries can be used by all applications in the system that need them. There is no need to install them separately for each program that requires them.
 
 Attention!
 
 VC ++ libraries are available in 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions. However, it does not matter what version of the operating system we have. The decisive factor is the application architecture for which we install the library package. So if we run a 32-bit application on a 64-bit system, we should choose 32-bit libraries.
