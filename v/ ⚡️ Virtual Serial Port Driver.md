> Virtual Serial Port Driver is an advanced configuration tool that allows you to emulate RS232 serial ports connected via a virtual null-modem cable by means of a virtual controller. With this application you can create an unlimited number of virtual pairs of serial ports without having to have a single physical port. Such a virtual port is seen by the system and programs like any other. The controller can also be easily embedded in the software it creates, which allows you to manage virtual ports directly from your own application. Using the Virtual Serial Port Driver, the user can create two virtual COM5 and COM6 ports, to which two different applications can be connected.
