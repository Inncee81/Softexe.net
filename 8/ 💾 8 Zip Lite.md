With this application, we will easily create a new archive of files (as many as five compression methods), open and unpack existing archives, encrypt or decrypt archives using the Windows Hello and Microsoft Passport functions, and run the contents of archives from the main 8 Zip Lite window (for example about documents, photos, films or music). 
 
 If necessary, the tool will allow you to send selected data via e-mail, make it available on the internet on social networks or put it "in the cloud" via OneDrive and Dropbox. Before doing this, it's a good idea to protect your files with 256-bit AES encryption. 8 Zip Lite has also been equipped with the function of printing files.
 
 Attention!
 
 The free version of the 8 Zip Lite program offers only support for the ZIP format! The full version supports zip, 7z, tar, gzip, bzip2 and xz (creation) formats as well as rar, zip, 7z, zipx, iso, bzip2, gzip, tar, arj, cab, cbz and cbr files (opening archives).
