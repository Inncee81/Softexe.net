The tool allows you to run movies saved on Blu-Ray and DVD media, as well as in the form of ISO files or from folders located on the hard disk. 8K Player supports both 1080p, Full HD, Ultra HD, 4K, 5K and 8K video. The program copes well with MOV, MKV, AVI, FLV, WMV, MP4, M4V, ASF, VOB, MTS and M2TS formats, as well as the movie's audio track saved as AVCHD, FLAC, AAC, MP3, OGG, WAV, WMA, AC3 or Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1 / 7.1.
 
 8K Player allows you to record selected fragments of movies, and also allows you to record user activity on the desktop, in a running application or a computer game, making it ideal for preparing various presentations. There is also an option to create screenshots of the material you are watching.
 
 The manufacturer of the described tool also took care of the presence of flaps. So we can add selected videos to a special menu to watch them in the next order or at other times.
