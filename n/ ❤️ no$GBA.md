The described tool is most compatible with all commercially available DS ROMs. The manufacturer has been developing them for over a dozen years, successively publishing new versions of the application. NO $ GBA can boast a minimalist and intuitive user interface - running games using this emulator runs extremely quickly and without any problems.
 
 NO $ GBA includes many customization options related to image display, graphics, sound, work mode and control. Controlling the characters in the games is possible using a gamepad / joystick or keyboard. Before we start playing, we will be able to assign individual actions to selected keys.
