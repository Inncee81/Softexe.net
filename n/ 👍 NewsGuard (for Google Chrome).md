The goal of the creators of NewsGuard is to combat unreliable journalism. Therefore, they have prepared a described tool which, using two colors, ie green and red, informs the user about whether a given site is trustworthy. On some of them, such as CNN or BBC, truthful messages, but on the Internet we find a lot of websites, whose authors publish untrue information.
 
 NewsGuard does not work automatically, so if after visiting a given website you do not see the icon in one of the mentioned colors, we will be able to send a request to review such a site by NewsGuard analysts.
