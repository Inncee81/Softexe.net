The application window does not contain too many elements - on the one hand, it does not threaten the many options of less experienced users, and on the other hand, it has all the features that you would expect from this type of software. From the main program window, we can move between consecutive files contained in the folder, trim the currently displayed image or rotate it, enable full-screen mode, or adjust the scale of the displayed file.
 
 We can also preview thumbnails of other graphic files in a given folder, display the information contained in the metadata (containing such data as exposure time, flash, focal length, time of taking the picture and more), and organize a slideshow or create a mosaic. The program can be easily adapted to your preferences, including and disabling individual panels and toolbars.
 
 Attention!
 
 The program is downloaded by default for newer editions of Windows (7/8/10). Users of Windows 2000 / XP / Vista are encouraged to use the version of the application prepared specifically for these operating environments. It is available for download from the 'all versions' option after selecting 'version for Windows 2000 / XP / Vista'.
