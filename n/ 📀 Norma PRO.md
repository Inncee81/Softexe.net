The program makes it possible to create cost estimates using a detailed, simplified and mixed method. It has advanced features that allow you to make variant cost estimates, complex and comparative cost estimates and create integrated items. It allows you to download batches / measurements from PDF files and is able to cooperate with the Norma EXPERT, Norma STANDARD, Measure PRO and the Internet Database of Prices of Building Materials - Intercenbud.pl .
