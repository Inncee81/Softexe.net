Among the features offered by the application, we find an interactive interface that allows you to discover the rules of notation, the exercise system with the ability to create your own sets, as well as a precise algorithm for recognizing sung and played sounds and melodies. In addition, Nootka reflects the natural sound of guitars, handles keys (treble clef, bass and others) and piano recording and provides analysis of results and support of various types of guitars and their costumes.
 
 The program is available for Windows, Linux, Mac OS and Android.
