> Few games can boast several decades on the back of the neck and are still being developed. The free NetHack project is undoubtedly a big phenomenon in this respect. The free title is recognized by many older players as a work of all time. He laid the foundations of contemporary RPG productions, developing the imagination of fantasy fans by introducing them to a random world of letters and symbols.

Like many representatives of the so-called roguelike trend, where we play a hero with only one life, NetHack does not focus on an advanced graphic design. After many years of production, the overlay has been replaced with symbols that replace certain graphic tiles, but at any time it is possible to return to the old visual garbage. In the package you will also find a separate file to run the game in the form in which it was brought to life, in the ravenous text window.
 
 
 At the beginning of the game, we give the name of the hero and decide on his sex, race, profession and the rule of law. Alternatively, we seem to be choosing a random one to start the adventure faster. The goal is to reach the lowest possible level of dungeons, killing monsters along the way, finding useful items, as well as developing the character. In the end it's archaic, but RPG. After death or interruption of the game, NetHack gives the nose a detailed statistics of what the heroos were achieved.
