It is a perfect complement to standard antiviruses, well dealing with the detection and removal of a specific type of pests such as scareware and rogueware, which after installation in the system lead the user to unknowingly download other malicious components from the Internet. Norton Power Eraser does not require installation, has a friendly interface in Polish and is very easy to use. Once launched, it thoroughly scans the contents of the disk or the indicated folder, and then allows you to delete selected items that may pose a potential threat to the user.
 
 The program works on the basis of sessions, enabling a quick restoration of the system to the original state in the case of eg removing correct applications.
