> No Coin is an add-on to Google Chorme that blocks the operation of cryptomonet excavators, which can work stitched in advertisements.

In general, it works analogously to ad blockers, but because it is a separate application, it allows you to separate decisions related to advertising from those regarding crypto-currency digging.
 
 The program works on the basis of a black list of addresses that are blocked. If necessary, it is possible to temporarily add the selected address to the white list.
