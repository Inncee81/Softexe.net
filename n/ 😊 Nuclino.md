This program can be easily adapted to your needs. Nuclino offers the possibility to enter text, provide it with numerous graphics, movies, blocks of code, attachments and more. All objects added are immediately shared with other logged-in users, and when one of them edits a given part of the workspace, the others can view it at the same time.
 
 Nuclino allows you to easily locate individual items located on the board thanks to the built-in search engine. You can do this not only from the desktop application, but even on a PC where it has not been installed. Nuclino has support for the web interface. It is enough to run any browser and log in to your account.
 
 It is worth noting that Nuclino allows you to export content to a variety of formats, such as PDF or Markdown. At the same time, the tool synchronizes data between devices in real time, so even if one of them fails (eg hard disk), all information will be read on the second computer.
 
 Attention!
 
 Nuclino requires the creation of a free user account.
