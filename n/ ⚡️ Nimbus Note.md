Having a lot of duties on your head, it is sometimes worth writing down things to do in one place and then "unhooking" the completed tasks. For this purpose, you can install Nimbus Note, which not only offers the above-mentioned features, but also allows you to share notes and synchronize entries between several devices. The last function means that the program will find its application both at home and in the company, for example.
 
 In a situation when our database of tasks to be carried out will grow to larger sizes, it is possible to search for notes based on previously created tags describing specific duties. Nimbus Note also allows you to place selected notes in specific folders, so you can freely divide them into various categories (eg work, school, projects, home duties).
 
 Attention!
 
 Nimbus Note requires the creation of a free user account.
