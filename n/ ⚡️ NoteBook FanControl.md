From the main window of the NoteBook FanControl program, we can choose one of many available configurations, specifying both the brand and the laptop model on which the described tool is installed. Importantly, the application supports devices manufactured by major companies, such as, for example, Asus, Lenovo, Sony, Dell, HP, Acer and many, many more.
 
 After the pre-preparation of the NoteBook FanControl for operation, we will go to the most important function, through which we can enable or disable the ability to control the fan speed, as well as modify its speed. Interestingly, the tool also displays information about the processor's operating temperature.
