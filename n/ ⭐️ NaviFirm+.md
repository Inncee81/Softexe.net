> NaviFirm + is a small but extremely useful tool for all owners of Nokia phones who would like to download the internal software (so-called firmware) for their device.

The program gives you the opportunity to download any version of the firmware released for any Nokia model ever released. Thanks to this, you can not only restore the phone's factory software, but also update it to the latest version, or change it to another language, for example in Polish or one that does not have the phone operator's settings and additions (eg wallpaper or start animation). The latter, although technically possible, may already be associated with the loss of the guarantee.
 
 Despite the lack of the Polish language version, NaviFirm + is very easy to use. From the level of one program window, the following steps are made: phone model selection, firmware version and the device variant we are interested in. In the case of some models, the number of variants available may cause a headache, hence at each stage the program gives the possibility to filter the results. To avoid mistakes, it is best to search for the desired firmware by entering the device code, which can usually be found on the nameplate under the battery. At the end, it remains only to indicate the elements that interest us and possibly indicate the appropriate folder on the hard disk.
 
 NaviFirm + downloads firmware images directly from the manufacturer's servers, so you can be sure that the software is original, complete and unmodified by unauthorized persons. The side functionality of the program is the ability to check product codes for all models and phone variants, including variants for individual markets (countries) and operators.
 
 The tool was created on the basis of the NaviFirm program by the Epicbiznus user from the Symbian-Freak.com forum. Marco Bellino extends them with further functions - detailed information on this subject can be found in the ReadMe.txt file.
 
 Since the NaviFirm + version 2.0 there have been profound changes. The program engine has been rewritten, there is no problem with downloading images after changes introduced by Nokia , improved product code list, implemented improved file caching (now it is supported by the server), transmitted files are compressed, the interface has been improved, and the program automatically will download and install your updates. Unfortunately, the program is currently payable - a symbolic donation of min. 3 Euro via PayPal (this can be done from the program level), but taking into account the usefulness of the tool, these are not excessive expectations on the part of the author. 
 
 Attention!
 
 NaviFirm + does not allow you to carry out the actual firmware update process. For this purpose, use dedicated tools such as Maemo Flasher for Nokia N900 / N9 smartphones.
 
 Any changes or upgrades of the firmware should be made only by experienced users because improperly carried out process can damage the phone. Changing the software during the warranty period beyond the authorized Nokia service centers may also result in the loss of the warranty.
