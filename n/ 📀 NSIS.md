NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) is a fully professional, free system for creating installers for Windows systems.

The appearance and functionality of the installer can be adapted to the needs of the application. For example, during the installation process, the installer can download the necessary libraries that are required to run the program or check if there is a newer version for download. Creating multilingual installers is also not a problem, because NSIS has more than 35 ready-made translations.
 
 In version 2, the developers added a new LZMA data compression system that gives a 20% better result than the previous BZip2. Installers for applications such as WinAmp and eMule have been created using the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System.
