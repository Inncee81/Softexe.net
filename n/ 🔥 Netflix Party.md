> Netflix Party is an add-on to the Google Chrome web browser, which allows you to watch selected movies, series or programs available in Netflix by many users at the same time.

After launching any video material on Netflix, just click the NP icon in the upper right corner of the main Chrome window, and then copy the address visible on the screen and pass it on to other session participants (they also need to be logged in to Neflix using, for example, a free period test). It is worth noting that during watching we can write messages in a text chat, for example to ask other people to stop the image.
 
 Keep in mind the fact that Netflix Party does not operate on the principle of streaming, but acts as a "virtual cinema" that allows you to watch movies, series and programs with selected people (each on your screen, but the image is synchronized so that everyone can see the same in that same time) and communicate with them via the Internet. 
 
 Attention!
 
 Netflix Party requires the creation of an account in the Netflix service. After registering, choose one of the possible payment options (credit card, PayPal, gift card) to start a free month. After 30 days, Netflix will automatically "withdraw" the amount for another month from our account, but if we want to prevent it, we can immediately enter the site and enter the account settings to cancel the membership.
