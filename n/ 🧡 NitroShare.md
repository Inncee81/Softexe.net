The program allows sending documents, photos, videos or any other data within the network, provided that the NitroShare application is installed on the source and target device. Such a solution can be an interesting alternative for sending large files by e-mail, copying them to an external hard disk or a pendrive.
 
 Once launched, NitroShare is available in the system tray where you can right-click it, choosing one of the two options "send file" or "send directory", and then locating data on your hard disk or other media. If you want to become familiar with the progress of sending files, use the "show transfers" option.
