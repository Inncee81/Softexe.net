Nuclear does not search the disk for music files. Instead, it allows you to search the sites with movies and music, and listen to the songs saved in the last.fm account. Before you search, you can choose places to visit. 
 
 
 Found songs will appear on the list. From here you can add a file to the download queue, build a playlist and the like. 
 
 
 The program is still in the trial version and may not work more advanced features, such as downloading song lyrics or finding related ones.
