After launching NVSlimmer, we need to indicate the path to write the driver installation file (previously you should download it from the official website of the manufacturer) so that the entire contents of the package appears on the screen. The most important elements that we need to install have been bolded, while others can be unchecked, so as not to place unnecessary additions on the hard drive (eg GeForce Experience and 3D Vision).
 
 Individual components of controllers are presented in a very transparent form. NVSlimmer divides them into various categories, thanks to which we can easily and quickly select or deselect any elements. After doing this, there is nothing else we can do but confirm the changes ("apply") and press the button responsible for the files installation. We can also create your driver package by selecting the "repackage" option.
