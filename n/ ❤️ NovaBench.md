The program consists of 6 simple benchmarks, using which it is possible to efficiently test the performance of the base components installed in the computer. They can be run all simultaneously or individually, depending on the user's preferences. With the help of benchmarks, we will test equipment for integer and floating point calculations, generation of MD5 hashs, 3D scene rendering and data write speed (RAM and hard disk).
 
 After finishing work, NovaBench creates a report containing the score obtained for each of the tested items. The saved summary can be saved on the disk in the form of an NBR file or made available online to compare the results obtained with other users.
 
 The NovaBench benchmark is available for Windows and Mac OS. In the case of the latter, you can also find it in the Mac App Store.Attention!
 The program requires .NET Framework libraries installed in version 2.0 or newer. The latest version of the .NET Framework can be downloaded in the section PROGRAMS -&gt; Add-ons -&gt; Libraries and other add-ons (see: Related Programs).
 
 For proper operation of the program, DirectX 9.0c or newer is required. It is available for download in the section PROGRAMS -&gt; Multimedia -&gt; Multimedia extensions and codecs (see: Related Programs).
