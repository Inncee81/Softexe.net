What can NordVPN do?
 
 Thanks to the described tool, we can connect to a fake IP address (NordVPN offers thousands of servers located in over 60 countries), thanks to which we will be anonymous on the network. This means that we will not see predefined ads displayed based on the history of the pages viewed, and we will also securely perform various transactions in public places, for example by logging in to your bank account.
 
 Access to blocked websites
 
 NordVPN also allows access to websites blocked in a given user's location due to the applicable copyright law. However, keep in mind that using this type of application can slow down your computer.
 
 The most important features of the program:
 
 access to thousands of servers in over 60 countries
 quick configuration (one mouse click is enough)
 the ability to access blocked websites
 secure use of public WiFi networks
 access to the free trial version
 
 Attention! 
 The program is available in the form of a 7-day free trial version. After the end of the trial period, we can purchase the application using one of several variants (eg 2.99 dollars per month for three years).
