Nexus Mod Manager not only allows you to download mods (using the built-in download manager), but also allows you to install, update and modify files.
 
 Once launched, the Nexus Mod Manager will automatically start scanning the hard disk for installed games to which you can download unofficial add-ons. If any game was not found, the user will be able to indicate the target path on the hard disk of the computer.
 
 If you do not have all the files that are necessary to upload mods, Nexus Mod Manager will display an appropriate message (eg no DSFix for Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition). After selecting a given production, we will get a list of categories in the form of a directory tree similar to the one we know from Windows Explorer, thanks to which we will be able to assign downloaded fashions to specific departments.
