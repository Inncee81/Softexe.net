The tool is characterized by many additional functions, which are not to be found in the mentioned Microsoft text editor, and at the same time offer a minimalist, clear interface. Using NFOPad, we can view NFO documents that also contain ASCII graphics, using basic text editing solutions. The program also supports Unicode encoding.
 
 NFOPad allows you to define the font type ANSI or ASCII and choose its color. Users of the program will appreciate the ability to detect hyperlinks and e-mail addresses, as well as use text search and direct document printing.
