Through Netflix, we gain access to a huge base of serials and films. This includes "House of Cards", "Breaking Bad" or "Orange is the new black". Currently, the Polish version of the site is not too rich in materials with a Polish teacher or even Polish subtitles. To use the service, you need to set up an account, specify the method of payment (credit card, PayPal) and the most popular movie genres (including cartoons, if the child is to use the Netflix).
 
 The Netflix application for Windows is free, but we can only watch movies for free during the monthly test period. Later you need to buy a subscription, which you can do using the application.
