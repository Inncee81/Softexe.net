> Nimbus Capture is a very easy to use and free tool that allows you to record everything that happens on your computer screen. With his help, we will make static screenshots, and we will record a simple video sequence (with sound) with our activity.

The application allows the user to define the area to be included in its operation. You can choose to register the whole screen or its selected part. In the case of recorded video, Nimbus Capture does not offer too many configuration options. Things are different when it comes to the so-called screenshots. Here, the user gets a simple graphic editor that allows to add different types of elements to the screenshots - hand-drawn drawings, text, arrows, blur effects, etc. Ready images can be saved in JPG, PNG or BMP format.
 
 Nimbus Capture has been made available for computers with Windows and Mac OS. It offers support for keyboard shortcuts significantly improving its service, and if we decide to register a user account on the manufacturer's website, the program will also allow us to conveniently share the effects of our work online, e.g. for friends.
