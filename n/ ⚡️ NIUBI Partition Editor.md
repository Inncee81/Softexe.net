The program has been equipped with all the necessary functions that allow you to easily and quickly create new partitions or resize existing ones. In the last case it is possible to change the size of the volume even if the operating system is installed on it. There was also a partition copy option, which can be useful when you create a data backup or migrate data to a new disk.
 
 NIUBI Partition Editor also has tools to help you split partitions into smaller ones, convert MBR to GPT, FAT32 to NTFS, and logical partitions to basic. Subsequently, mention should be made of the function of changing the letter or label of the volume, defragmenting it, hiding or deleting it or permanently deleting data.
