The program offers a number of interesting functions and tools to manage outgoing and incoming traffic within our computer. In addition to the elementary functions of statistics and graphs showing the real-time transfer level, NetLimiter provides detailed information on the applications that generate this traffic. With its help, we can constantly monitor processes that use the Internet connection and, if necessary, impose transfer limits on them. Such a scenario allows the user to comfortably use many programs that charge our connection, without fear that one of them will completely clog them.
 
 Another advantage of NetLimiter is the filter and rule mechanism, which allows the user to set limits, etc., in which periods they should apply, the direction, IP range in which they are to apply, and many others. The program offers the possibility of remote control and monitoring of other computers.
 
 
 
 
 Attention!
 The trial version allows you to use the program for a period of 27 days.
