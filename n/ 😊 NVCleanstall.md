> NVCleanstall is a very useful, very light tool from the creators of the popular GPU-Z, which allows you to customize the installation of the GeForce card driver and is also an alternative to the original upgrade module in the GeForce Experience.

Using NVCleanstall, we can choose exactly what driver components should be installed. The default installer always installs the full package, even if your graphics card model does not allow you to use the function, or you do not want to do it yourself. In addition, the application can remove telemetry used by Nvidia.
 
 The program takes into account dependencies between individual modules, so theoretically there is no fear that the removal of any function will negatively affect another desired one.
 
 Last but not least, NVCleanstall downloads the driver immediately, without any discarded components, from the creator server, TechPowerUp. So it also allows you to save some time for people with weaker links, as well as notifies you of the latest available driver version.
