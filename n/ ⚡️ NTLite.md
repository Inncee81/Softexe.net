NTLite is a handy tool for modifying distributions of Windows operating systems - 7, 8, 8.1 and 10. This allows you to create your own build with the specified parameters, a set of components and settings (programs, drivers, languages, etc.). In addition, with the help of the NTLite program, embedding the necessary system updates and fixes into the distribution kit is available.

By eliminating unnecessary (in your opinion) system components, you reduce the overall size of the installation package, save disk space, optimize the speed of future OSes, etc. You can also use additional tools to configure some of the operating system settings using a variety of built-in tweaks.

Thus, if you like to experiment, laying out alternative assemblies of Windows on forums and torrent resources, then NTLite will become your good helper, allowing you to greatly simplify all operations with the distribution.

The main characteristics of NTLite:


The possibility of modifying both a separate OS distribution kit and an already installed operating system.
Orientation on the available "iron".
Integration into the driver package.
Inclusion in the distribution of updates and additions.
Improve and customize the assembly due to the built-in tweaks and much more.
