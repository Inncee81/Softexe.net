> Nighthawk is a discreet multimedia player with a modern, transparent interface and an option to automatically scan the user's library.

Shortly after starting Nighthawk is minimized to the system tray, from which we can "call" it to define individual options. If this solution does not suit us, then we will easily turn it off from the main menu and the tool will always be opened in a large window like other programs.
 
 Although Nighthawk is enabled, this fact does not appear on the taskbar. This may be useful if we have too many applications turned on and we do not want the next one to introduce unnecessary confusion while working, and yet we like to listen to music while performing various duties on the computer.
 
 Using Nighthawk is possible using multimedia keys, so you do not have to reach for the tray every time, for example to stop the song or switch to the next one. These operations can also be performed by right-clicking on the program icon next to the system clock.
