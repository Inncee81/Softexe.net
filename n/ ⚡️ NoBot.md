```sh
NoBot is a small application used to search for malware on the user's computer.

The program copes well with locating bots, keyloggers as well as many other undesirable files. At the same time, NoBot is characterized by the simplicity of operation, as a result of which the use of the tool is limited only to selecting the 'scan' tab and pressing the button with the same name. In addition to the ability to scan the entire hard disk, we can also select individual files to check.
 
 NoBot also allows you to define exceptions, ie files that the program will not take into account during scanning. These infected people go to quarantine, where we decide ourselves whether we want to remove them.
