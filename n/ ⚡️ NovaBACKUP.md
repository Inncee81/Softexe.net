The tool is multifunctional and very easy to use, thanks to which less experienced users will also be able to prepare the back-up. NovaBACKUP allows you to back up data "manually" or according to a set schedule. We can save our files not only in the selected destination path located on our hard disk, but also on an external device or in the cloud (such services as: Dropbox, OneDrive, OneDrive for Business, Google Drive, iDriveSync, SkyDrive and SafeSync) .
 
 NovaBACKUP certainly appreciate users who, for example, have a large library of films. In this case, the backup may take a long time, so the tool allows you to automatically shut down the computer after completing the operation related to the preparation of the backup.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 15 days.
