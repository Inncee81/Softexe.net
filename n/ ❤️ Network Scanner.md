The program provides a wide range of information, giving them all as part of a simple user interface, the main part of which is a table containing all collected data. The application scans the computers present in the network and provides information such as IP addresses and physical (MAC) addresses, checks the status of TCP and UDP ports, shared resources and services, and more.
 
 Among the available functions, it is worth mentioning the built-in Whois tool providing information about the owners of specific domains, a tool for checking the IP addresses of websites entered and the ability to remotely close and perform actions.
