The program has a readable and fully functional user interface, in which we will find special modules to support the creation and supplementation of documentation. The user can manage the doctor's work time, define working hours, the number of patients to be taken and register patients using an electronic schedule.
 
 
 Netgabinet.pl offers the possibility of setting up and modifying a patient database in which we will enter the most important information. In the program, we can enter information about the patient's current health, choose medically appropriate diagnosis, complete all ordered imaging and analytical tests along with the administration of appropriate drugs (prescription, etc.). 
 
 
 In addition, the program allows issuing invoices and bills for contractors or patients, as well as compiling various statistics on daily admissions of patients, commissioned tests and many other activities performed within one working day. There was also no definition of free days and working hours using the built-in module for creating a physician's work schedule. 
 Attention!
 After the first launch of the program, you should make a free registration by entering your login and password.The demo version of the program allows you to test it for 7 days. By using this version, the user has access to a partial index of drugs. In order to gain full access to it, you must register from the program level and enter the serial number with the password, which will be sent electronically to the e-mail address provided.
