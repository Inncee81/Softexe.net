We will find here, among other things, the Neighbor protocol, thanks to which we will be able to take advantage of additional options, such as searching for torrents in other Neighbor clients or through the so-called. communities that operate on the principle of websites, where various torrents are stored (remote search of such files is possible). Neighbor also includes Webtorrent libraries, which makes the application not only support standard torrent network protocols.
 
 Neighbor allows not only downloading, but also creating your own torrents. We can also locate them by name, tag, language or description (these data are included in other clients or on social channels). Attention is also drawn by the fact that the application provides the option of streaming downloaded content (we can play movies before we download the entire file to the computer's hard drive).
