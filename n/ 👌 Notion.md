> Notion can be easily described as the user's workspace, on which he will store various information. Once you start typing, the program interface fades out, so we can completely focus on the work.

When running the tool, you must log in to your Google account (if you do not have one, we can set it up for free), then configure the application by answering simple questions, setting the username and - if you want - modifying the avatar. Performing these activities leads us to the last step, that is, to set up your own workspace. We give it any name, and then we get a link, so we can use it also using any web browser.
 
 Notion allows you to store notes, task lists, information from Wikipedia, and allows you to manage databases. Interestingly, by configuring the tool, we can also import numerous materials (eg HTML documents, CSV files, texts written in Word and many, many more), adapting the tool to your own preferences. The authors also suggest downloading the application for mobile devices, so we can gain access to the workspace even when we are not at the computer.
 
 It is worth mentioning that Notion offers the function of sharing materials and inviting other users, so we will also use the workspace while performing group tasks at school or while working on projects in the company.
