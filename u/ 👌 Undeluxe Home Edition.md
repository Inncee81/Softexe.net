```sh
Undeluxe Home Edition is a free edition of an unusual tool that can be compared to the improved version of the system's basket mechanism. The program allows you to protect against deletion not only files deleted by the file explorer, but also data deleted by other applications without the user's knowledge.

After starting the program, all you need to do is press the Start button to start the process of monitoring changes in files on your hard disk. After some time, you can look into the window that allows you to view the deleted files and recover them if necessary. More advanced users can additionally configure the application by choosing even monitored disks and partitions and creating a special list of folders that are always to be monitored - or which should not be taken into account during the program's operation. Some options, however, are not available in the free version of Home Edition.
 
 Undeluxe Home Edition is an interesting proposition, which, however, will be useful to more administrators than the average computer user. It is worth mentioning that the authors made sure that their software was quite clever: temporary files and folders as well as files with TMP, BAK and similar extensions are automatically ignored, thanks to which the program does not waste time monitoring unimportant files that we would not like anyway recover.
