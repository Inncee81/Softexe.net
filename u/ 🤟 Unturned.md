> Unturned is a sandbox action game that is unique in many respects. It's not only a successful combination of Minecraft with a fight for survival in a virtual world full of hungry zombies, but also a science that when you really want something, you can be successful. The title is the work of one talented programmer. When his first version appeared, young Nelson Sexton, the producer of this game, was less than 16 years old.

The product is reminiscent of a popular angular hit, mainly due to the especially economical graphics. The colorful locations, therefore, enjoy the eyes with colors rather than the details of the objects and characters. The player is thrown on the selected server and must simply survive in a sinister environment. At first, he has nothing to defend, so he thinks and looks around for useful items. Good weaponry is not the end of worries, because Unturned also has a gameplay system that takes into account factors such as hunger, thirst, disease or chilling.
 
 You can play alone or with someone online. For an additional fee, you gain access to the game with more objects falling out of your enemies, getting more experience plus a few cosmetic bonuses, but this does not make the basic version somehow worse. Next is the option to build your own cube bases after a cube, barricades and traps. You still need to take care of food supplies by farming, fishing and hunting for wild animals. Several levels of difficulty allow you to choose the challenge appropriate to the player's skills and expectations.
 
 Of course, there is a lot of fun just wandering around and discovering different places and possibilities. The creator tries to regularly update his game with new content prepared in accordance with what Unturned fans demand.
 
 Attention!
 
 In order to install the game, you should download Steam - a platform client that allows you not only to buy and download computer games, but also to offer players the opportunity to contact each other, exchange experiences and have fun together.
