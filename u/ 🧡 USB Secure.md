Securing access to pendrive and other USB storage devices
 
 The use of the USB Secure program is very simple and properly limited to the setting of the already mentioned string of characters after connecting the selected media to the USB port. It can be not only an external drive, but also a memory stick, memory card and many, many more.
 
 Data loss after removing the USB flash drive quickly? It's not a problem
 
 If you want to access your documents, photos, songs or any other materials, you can choose between completely unlocking files or accessing files locked on a virtual disk. This is a useful function in situations when we are afraid of losing files when the media is suddenly unplugged from the USB port.
 
 What to do if you lose your USB drive?
 
 USB Secure has a function that allows you to save valuable information (eg e-mail address or phone number), which can be restored by the discovery of our external disk, flash drive, etc., so that it will be able to contact us.
 
 It works on every computer
 
 It is worth noting that USB Secure is compatible with all USB devices, and also works on any version of the Windows operating system, supporting FAT, FAT32 and NTFS file systems. In addition, the application does not require installation or administrator privileges, so we can make use of it on any computer.
