Undoubtedly, the big advantage of this software is adaptation to Polish law, and each subsequent update of the application introduces necessary changes in this respect. Thanks to this, we do not have to fear changes in the law and avoid thinking about necessary changes. The program has all the necessary tools for the entrepreneur, allowing not only to issue title invoices and receipts, but also to control stock levels, create product pricelists and more. We can easily generate various reports or build a database of individual clients and companies, including grouping for easier sorting of the table.
 
 Uni Faktura is a noteworthy proposition for companies that need a tool to handle not only invoices. The program can significantly improve the work of the company and improve the flow of information (integration with the network allows it to use it on many positions), and the service is largely based on wizards and filling subsequent windows and forms.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 60 days.
