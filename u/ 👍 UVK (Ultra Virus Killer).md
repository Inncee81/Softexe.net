The first thing that catches the eye after launching the application is a large number of options. The program offers a number of functions to help maintain the system in a good form, from scanning and removing malware threats along with the system immunization to similar threats, through the application and user manager uninstaller, to the autostart management module, the manager of running processes and services, system information and not only. The number of tools is really large, thus offering many features that we normally have to look for in several separate applications.
 
 In addition, UVK has a System Booster module that allows you to optimize and increase system performance by removing unnecessary objects and files from the hard disk and registry. The memory management module is also valuable, allowing to eliminate, for example, a dangerous virus running in the background.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version of the program has some limitations in functionality, e.g. allowing the system to be immunized only on one user account.
