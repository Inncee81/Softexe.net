The application is characterized by rich functionality and a clear and intuitive user interface. While listening to music on the computer, the program displays all the most important information about the currently playing music file, from which we can read the song title and album, genre, year of production and commentary. In addition, it has the most important options for handling multimedia files and a function for playing CDs.
 
 The program also includes a built-in manager to manage all files on the computer's hard drive. With its help, we can search for various types of files and perform many other useful operations (copying, moving and renaming files). In addition, it informs about the amount of free and used space on the data carrier, and also shows the total number of all files and directories located on individual partitions.
 
 Ubiquitous Player was also equipped with a user-friendly image file browser that allows you to modify photos and create a slide show. Users can also browse the websites using the built-in browser from the program level, perform various calculations using a calculator and write or edit any document in an advanced text editor.
