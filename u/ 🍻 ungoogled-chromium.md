```sh
ungoogled-chromium is a Chromium browser built using a special set of flags, patches and scripts that are designed to remove or disable all services and functions that could threaten privacy, eliminate binary modules and replace them built with source code, and modify mechanisms to impact on user control and transparency of the browser.

ungoogled-chromium uses patches prepared by Debian developers, the Inox project and the Iridium browser. In addition, all references to Internet domains have been replaced in the source code by references to the non-existent domain qjz9zk, the functionality associated with Google domains has been removed, URL formatting has been removed in Omnibox, WebRTC and intranet redirects.
 
 JavaScript dialog boxes appear when you try to close the pages and you have to force pop-ups into the tabs. The option of blocking Omnibox search has also been added and Google's Safe Browsing mechanism has been discarded. In the menu, the function of cleaning the HTTP authentication buffer appeared.
 
 As a result, a very good Chromium was created, certainly much more privacy-protecting than what Google offers.
