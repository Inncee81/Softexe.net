Often it happens that the operating system refuses to be obedient and there is nothing else we can do to install it from scratch - in this situation it will certainly be useful to just the boot disc, which is in fact Windows placed on a CD or DVD equipped with a boot loader. Previously, such operations could have been successfully carried out using a floppy disk, but in currently manufactured computers, no more stations for this type of storage medium are mounted.
 
 Ultimate Boot CD runs the diagnostic tools from the CD extremely quickly and easily, so it can be an alternative even when you have a floppy disk drive. It is worth mentioning that the program can also be run directly from a mobile device connected to the USB port on new computers that support system loading in this way.
