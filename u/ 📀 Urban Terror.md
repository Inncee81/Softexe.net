> Urban Terror is a classic FPS combining the advantages and characteristics of such famous productions as: Quake III: Arena and Counter Strike. Differences, however, between Urban terror and the aforementioned productions rely on a higher realism and dynamism of the action. In addition, in addition to cunning and dexterity, the player requires appropriate and thought-out tactics, which often turns out to be the key to victory. In achieving this goal, it also helps to merge into battle groups with other players.

For attention in the latest version of Urban Terror deserves the addition of new models of weapons (including those used by authentic soldiers - Beretta 92FS, Franchi SPAS12 or Heckler &amp; Koch MP5K) with improved hit systems, new player statistics system or improved physics of characters, as well as the whole game. The game also features a number of new and improved old maps - action from closed, dark catacombs gets out, even to places close to us from everyday life.
