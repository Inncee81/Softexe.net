DLNA (The Digital Living Network Alliance) is a communication standard used by electronic device manufacturers offering the possibility of sharing multimedia resources (movies, music, photos) between different devices connected to the home network. For example, if you have a DLNA device and a WiFi network in your home, you can view our media without having to connect the computer with additional cables with TV.
 
 Universal Media Server offers both the possibility of native sharing (stremowania) of multimedia supported by the device, eg MP3, JPG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, AVI, MP4, TS, M2TS, MPEG for PS3, as well as the transcoding function (on the fly) ) formats that are not supported by the device, eg MKV, FLV, OGM, OGG, FLAC, MPC, APE. Another interesting option offered by the Universal Media Server application is the ability to display subtitles for movies saved in TXT format, also when the device does not have such a function.
 
 The application is compatible with devices such as AC Ryan PlayOn! HD, Apple iPhone, Asus O! Play, Brite-view CinemaTube, DirecTV HR, Freebox HD, LG Smart TV Upgrader, Nokia N900, Panasonic TVs, Philips Net TV, Philips Streamium, Popcorn Hour, Samsung TVs, Sharp Aquos, Sony Bravia , Sony PlayStation 3, Vizio Smart TV, XBMC Media Center, Yamaha A / V receivers, Apple iPad, Apple iPod, Boxee, D-Link DSM, Freecom MusicPal, Google Android, Microsoft Xbox 360, OPPO blu-ray players, Philips Aurea , Philips PFL, Pioneer Kuro, Realtek media players, Samsung UPC Horizon, Showtime, Sony blu-ray players, Sony SMP-N100, Western Digital WD TV Live and Xtreamer.
