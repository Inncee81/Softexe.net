The program is addressed to both less and more experienced users. It offers two modes of operation - simplified and advanced, giving access to many useful options. In the default, simple mode, the user creates the mentioned USB key in three simple steps. All you have to do is set a password, select the USB stick that you want to use to protect your computer and activate the tool.
 
 The second of these USB Raptor modes has been created for more demanding customers. It offers access to many configuration options, with the help of which we can customize many attributes of the tool's work to individual preferences. We will find in it functions allowing to determine, among others when the program is to be run, what elements of the system are to be blocked and with what delay and many other useful options.
 
 The principle of operation of the USB Raptor is very simple and enables such protection of the computer, in which use of it will be possible only after connecting the USB flash drive to the USB port. When it is removed, the system will be blocked and access to it will not be possible without reconnecting the key.
