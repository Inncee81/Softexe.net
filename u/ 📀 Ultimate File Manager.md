The goal of the UFM project is to create the best environment for running your favorite applications from one place. The main application is the well known and respected Total Commander file manager or its free equivalent of Multi Commander. UFM allows you to manage all your files and applications in the best and easiest way. It's a properly configured, easy-to-use and powerful environment.
 
 The Ultimate File Manager package installer allows you to install a properly configured file manager, plug-ins extending its functionality and appropriately selected external applications. Due to the size of the project, the UFM package is distributed in two versions - LITE and FULL (the only significant difference between them is the number of external applications that are components of the package).
