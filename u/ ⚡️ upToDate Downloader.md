```sh
upToDate Downloader is seemingly another download manager, but in fact it offers an interesting feature that distinguishes it from other applications of this type.

In the main upToDate Downloader window we can add a link to the chosen installer so that the described tool regularly checks whether the current version of the specified file is on our disk. Thanks to this, we will have up-to-date versions of our applications and drivers for various components of our computer.
 
 Creating a list of programs that upToDate Downloader will track is limited to pasting the link to the website and clicking one button. The tool stores the download data associated with each file listed, comparing the information on the server with those available in the directory indicated by the user.
 
 upToDate Downloader allows you to modify, export, import and even combine several link lists into one. The application can be downloaded for free.
