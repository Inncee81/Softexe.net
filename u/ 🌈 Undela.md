This program can be useful to any user, when he for various reasons lost access to valuable data for him. With its help, we will restore data deleted without the participation of the system's recycle mechanism or if it has been emptied, deleted due to the activity of malicious software or hardware failure. Undela allows you to restore individual files, entire directories, compressed data, and preview before previewing the contents of graphic files or text documents. In the case of a large amount of files detected by the tool, the mechanism of the built-in search engine and masks turns out to be useful.
 
 Undela offers 3 modes of searching for lost data - Scan, Full Scan and Advanced Scan. They allow you to carry out a quick or accurate analysis of the carrier, as well as indicate the area (sectors) taken into account while the program is running. All data found and recoverable are presented on the list in the form of a tree. The recovery process itself is limited to indicating selected items from the list and defining the location in which they will be saved.
 
 Among the filesystems supported by Undel, we can find, among others, NTFS, NTFS5, FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, XFS, HFS and HFS +. The tool successfully supports data created from both Windows, Linux and Mac OS.
