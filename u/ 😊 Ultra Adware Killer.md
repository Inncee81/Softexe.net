It successfully manages potentially unwanted applications (PUPs), toolbars, advertisements, unwanted search engine providers or browser plug-ins. The program also allows you to fight against malicious programs, Trojans, rootkits, ransomware and all other forms of malware.
 
 The tool is a component of another popular tool to fight viruses - UVK - Ultra Virus Killer. It does not require installation to operate, and despite the lack of the Polish language version, it should not cause any problems to anyone. After launching Ultra Adware, Killer performs a thorough computer scan in search of all dangerous components, allowing you to remove all or selected components.
 
 The program offers the possibility of creating system restore points, as well as creating the so-called whitelist with trusted ingredients.
