UFS Explorer Professional Recovery is a set of professional data recovery tools that support a large number of file systems, operating systems and various types of drives: from simplest to complex composite storage (RAID arrays of different levels).

Allows you to work with complex cases of data loss on a wide range of file systems. Allows you to change the original information on the media.

UFS Explorer Professional Recovery features:


Virtual reconstruction and recovery of data from RAID arrays.

RAID0 (including RAID-on-RAID, such as RAID1 + 0, RAID 50, etc.), RAID3 (RAID4, RAID7) with support for data distribution (stripes) at the byte level, RAID5 (most common parity distributions and delayed support parity), RAID6 (most standard parity distributions, including those specific to ARECA RAID).
Recover NAS arrays with XFS, Ext3, UFS file systems, such as Buffalo LinkStation and TeraStation, Iomega StorCenter, Adaptec Snap Servers (both Snap OS and Guardian OS), Promise Technologies SamrtStor, LaCie Intel NAS solutions, and so on.
Support for importing vim files. Allows you to open any virtual copy files created using Runtime Software products, and use them for data recovery.


Direct access to data supported file systems. Allows you to access data on all supported file systems, including file systems on a disk image, virtual disk, RAID array, etc., without the need for prior scanning.
Recovery after formatting. Even if you do not know which file system was previously, options will be offered.
Data recovery based on sector recovery (raw recovery). Uses the original technology IntelliRAW.
Disk-to-disk function. It can open images or virtual disks from any file system available in the UFS Explorer. Also allows you to get low-level access to data. For example, access to virtual disks of a running Hyper-V server blocked by the system, access to CD / DVD images of “parallel” operating systems located in file systems, etc.
Contextual data analysis and error correction.

It allows you to determine the location of the file / folder identifier, their contents, the map of fragments and move between them.
If there is a problem with the contents of the file, UFS Explorer allows you to find the "problem" fragment and fix it.
With the help of the Hex editor, you can fix both simple and serious file system problems (edit directory entries, move superblocks, fix identifiers, etc.) to make it work again.


Localization. It detects file names even on file systems that do not support unicode and recognizes UTF-16, UTF-8, ASCII with local code pages.
