The application offers support for Dropbox, Google Drive and OneDrive, or internet disks, thanks to which we can store data "in the cloud". We can manage them using an easy-to-use interface. In addition, there is an option to attach the created archive to an e-mail, record to a CD or DVD, and upload to FTP.
 
 UltimateZip allows you to secure your data using the 256-bit AES or Twofish encryption algorithm. If this is not enough, we can also secure the selected data archive using the created password. In addition, it offers a standard interface type for this type of application, so that the use of it will not cause a problem even for less experienced users.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
