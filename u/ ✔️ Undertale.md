During the game, we play as a man who found himself in an underground world inhabited by monsters. Obviously, the protagonist's task is to escape from this place, but it will not be an easy mission to accomplish. Especially that the fight in Undertale is not necessary, because the game offers unique mechanics allowing for negotiations with opponents.
 
 Undertale is not only confrontations with enemies (not clashes, because you can avoid them), but also exploration of the location and solving logic puzzles. In the course of the game, we must also make choices that will affect the story, leading to one of many endings. Since we're dealing with a non-linear game, it's worth going through it many times to get to know all the story's threads.
 
 Despite quite serious subject matter, Undertale does not shy away from humor. In addition, the fun is made more enjoyable by the fact that during the campaign the author of the game directly turns to the player. Speaking of the producer, it should be noted that it is an independent creator, Toby Fox, who has not created any other production before.
