Thanks to UserBenchmark, in less than a minute we can test the speed of the processor, graphic card, hard drive, SSD and portable memory that communicates with the PC via the USB connector. After the test, a comprehensive report appears on the screen (you can also compare the results on the manufacturer's website). As a result, we will receive a list of strengths and weaknesses of these systems, which will allow us to evaluate the performance of our computer.
 
 On the official UserBenchmark website, we can also read detailed information about the various components that have been tested using this application by users from around the world. The site is available in English. From its level, you can also get links to foreign stores that have a given device in their offer.
