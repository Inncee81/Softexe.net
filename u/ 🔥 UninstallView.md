> UninstallView is a small and undemanding utility that is designed to manage software installed on a Windows computer.

[![UninstallView](https://gallery.dpcdn.pl/imgc/Tools/75778/g_-_420x350_1.5_-_x20170517122022_0.jpg)](https://softexe.net/win/system/uninstallers/uninstallview:hpgd.html)

The program is very easy to use and is an interesting alternative to the 'Programs and Features' module or 'Add / Remove Programs' offered by the operating environment. It allows convenient uninstallation of unnecessary applications and games, while having access to a lot of useful information about each of them. We find among them data on the exact designation of the version, the user account for which the item was installed, the manufacturer, the location of the uninstaller, the name of the installer, the size of the file, the language and the key in the system registry.
 
 From the UninstallView level, we can also easily generate an HTML report containing all of the information about the software installed on the computer.
 
 Attention!
 Crack to the program is available in the section PROGRAMS -&gt; Extras -&gt; Polish locations (see: Related Programs).
