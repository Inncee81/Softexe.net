The program allows for low-level (sector by sector) replication of data from the selected hard disk and their recording in the form of IMG image. You can open the image at a later stage in any disk image tool, and then extract the files that are important for us. Lumin Disk Image also has the option of cloning disks, with the help of which we will transfer data to a new hard disk and a disk health monitoring module, which in turn will inform us in advance about a possible data warehouse failure.
 
 Lumin Disk Image has been made available for Windows and Mac OS system platforms. Its handling is so simple that it should not cause problems even to less experienced users.
