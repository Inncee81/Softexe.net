 Leapic Media Converter not only allows you to add, delete and move selected files from the list placed in the main program window, but also allows you to play your media. We can sort them by name, size, format, duration, date of editing or type of codec. If necessary, it is worth using the function of cropping and rotating movies.
 
 Leapic Media Converter does not install any additional codecs on the hard disk, because they are all embedded in the application.
