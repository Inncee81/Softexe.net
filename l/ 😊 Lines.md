The application contains useful templates (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and TXT), checks PHP syntax errors during saving, allows working on several projects at the same time (individual files are opened on tabs), supports Unicode, UTF-8, ANSI, ASCII encoding (also includes a coding converter and text), and also offers access to the embedded web browser and word search function directly from the level of the described tool. 
 
 Lines are characterized by a minimal user interface, thanks to which the vast majority of the application area takes the place to enter text.
