The program offers a very intuitive and clear interface. Tool support is largely based on placing objects from the library on the stage, and a series of special effects including animation of clouds, water and lighting is done by moving the slider. Thanks to this solution, the tool should not cause problems for novice users.
 
 One of the most important advantages of the Lumion application is the ability to import 3D models created using external programs. Are supported, among others formats (DAE, FBX, MAX, 3DS, OBJ, DXF) created by such programs as 3D Studio MAX, AutoCAD, Blender and Google Sketchup. By default Lumion is delivered with model libraries, among which you can find buildings, cars, animals, furniture and street objects, roads, sidewalks, people, stones and rocks or fences. People, animals, trees, bushes and grass are animated.
 
 Effects such as modification of terrain topology, solar lighting, atmospheric conditions including cloud cover, haze and water are carried out in real time. This is possible due to the use of the graphics card processor during editing and rendering of the scene. The program allows you to render individual frames as well as create animations in the form of a movie.
