Interestingly, LuxMark allows you to run GPU and CPU tests together or separately. It is worth adding that the originator of this program is Jean-Francois 'Jromang' Romang, who in 2009 prepared this tool to promote LuxCoreRender. Now, however, it is fully independent, as well as the most popular and most frequently used benchmark of this type.
 
 LuxMark offers a few scenes of varying complexity enabling the performance of various benchmarks and stress tests. The whole can boast of an uncomplicated, easy to use user interface.
