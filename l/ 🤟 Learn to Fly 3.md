The game consists of 4 modes: Story, in which we systematically improve the ship and try to fly as high as possible, Payload - here we focus on engine power and lift weights up, Classic, where for a change we fight for distance, which profoundly affects the type of used strategy and Sandbox - a trial, experiment and play mode with mixing all available properties and attributes.
 
 The key to success in the game is to construct the best and most efficient carrier for our penguin using the means available at the moment. Funds can, of course, be multiplied indefinitely and thus constantly upgrade the vehicle, but this is closely related to the number of flights. In general, the longer we stay in the air, the more cash falls into us.
 
 Learn to Fly 3 has a very extensive system of progress and development of the unit, additionally enriched with a system of achievements and various upgrades that have a large impact on many aspects of the game. The result is that the game is not boring quickly. It plays very nice with it, and the game itself soothes the nerves and works in a stress-relieving way ;-).
 
 Attention!
 
 In order to install the game, you should download the Steam program - a special internet platform that allows you not only to buy and download computer games, but also to offer players the opportunity to contact each other, exchange experiences and play together.
