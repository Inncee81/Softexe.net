The new calendar is distinguished by an unusual, intuitive and legible interface that integrates perfectly with the email client Mozilla Thunderbird. In addition, the Lightning plugin adds a new bar to the program, displaying the current date and informing about upcoming events. 
 
 
 Using this small program, we can also plan various events, as well as save important tasks in the calendar, which should be implemented in a timely manner. It is enough to mark the appropriate day and then fill in the individual fields, entering the name of the given event or task. 
 
 
 The program will find useful filters to help you view your saved events and other tasks. In addition, the Lightning plug-in allows you to create and manage several calendars at the same time, and also has a special function by which you can publish the calendar on an external web server.
