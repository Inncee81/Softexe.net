> LatencyMon Home Edition is a free edition of the tool, with the help of which we can check what slows down our computer and makes it even difficult to watch multimedia files, including streamed online content.

If you are dealing with clear, noticeable lags (delays) while watching video files and when performing different actions on them, then it is possible that one of the running processes or a malfunctioning driver is a problem. With this application you can track the cause of problems and analyze your system for occurring delays. All you need to do is run the monitoring and the program will start collecting all the information you need, presenting it in several tabs.
 
 LatencyMon Home Edition automatically creates statistics from the currently monitored session and provides a lot of information, such as the average time of performing operations on specific processor cores, the highest time for the controller to perform the action and the total time that the driver or device has "occupied". With this information, you can identify the problem, which in turn should help to fix it.
