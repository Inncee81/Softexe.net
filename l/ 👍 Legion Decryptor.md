It can be recognized by the fact that after encrypting the files, a long extension is added to their name ._23-06-2016-20-27-23_ $ f_tactics @ aol.com $ .legion (eg mojplik.pdf._23-06- 2016-20-27-23_$f_tactics@aol.com$.legion). The desktop wallpaper is also changed: on the white background there is an inscription informing about encrypting the data and displaying the e-mail address f_tactics@aol.com in red.
