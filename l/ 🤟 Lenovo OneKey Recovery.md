The program allows you to easily restore the operating system to factory settings when there are any problems with its correct operation. It uses for this purpose a special, hidden partition containing the name Recovery, which stores all the necessary files to reset the system, as well as backups.
 
 Another useful option of Lenovo OneKey Recovery is the system backup, which gives the user the ability to create a system backup with all applications, games or settings and save it to a disk image file. In the future, it can be used to quickly restore the computer to the state recorded in the mentioned image.
