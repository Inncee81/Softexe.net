The program was written in Java language and despite its relatively large possibilities it is very easy to use. Its main task is to obtain a native EXE extension for applications written in Java and distributed as JAR files. In addition, Launch4j allows manipulation of many programmable and user-relevant attributes of the software being produced. It is possible, among others defining the icon for the application, process name, start / maximum size of the heap, specifying the minimum required version of the Java virtual machine, adding information about the program, as well as the digital signature.
 
 The features of Launch4j are small size and the ability to use the tool using GUI or from the command line. The tool was released in versions for Windows, Linux and Mac OS.
