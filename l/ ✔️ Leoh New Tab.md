Leoh New Tab is one of the most interesting extensions for Google Chrome, which allows you to personalize the appearance of a new tab in the browser.

With the help of this small addition, each new card can contain as a background nice photos or even animation with sound (eg waterfall, stream, etc.). Going forward, the user can view the current time and date, metrological information for the defined location, and even short sentences (unfortunately in English).
 
 However, this is not the end, Leoh New Tab allows you to view a small tool for creating notes and to-do lists on each new tab.
