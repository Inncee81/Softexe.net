LosslessCut is an easy to use program for trimming movies. It allows you to precisely indicate the starting and ending point of the movie, and then, without unnecessary additional editing, export the file to disk. MP4, MOV, WebM, MKV, OGG, WAV, MP3, AAC, H264, Theora, VP8 and VP9 formats are supported. The source of the program is open.

Of course, the work should start by importing the file for editing, and this can be done in two ways. The first and classic is the choice of the recording from the Explorer (we get to it using the options on the top bar), while the second is a more convenient dragging the movie to the interface area.
 
 The imported movie can be reproduced here, and then precisely indicate the start and end points on the timeline. To increase accuracy, it is possible to move the recording even at every frame. Virtually all program functions can also be activated with keyboard shortcuts. Their full list will be displayed after pressing the letter "h".
 
 The program source is available on GitHub .
