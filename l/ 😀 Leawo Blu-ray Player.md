The application has been equipped with a simple but aesthetic and fully customizable graphical interface. We will not find unnecessary sounds on it, but only the most important functions of the player. In addition to the possibility of playing DVD and BD media, the program also allows you to watch movies in many commonly used formats (AVI, MPEG, WMV, MP4, FLV, RMVB, MOV, XviD, 3GP, TS, TRP, VOB, MPG, ASF etc.), including 1080p quality. There could also be a function of displaying subtitles, playing audio files (AAC, AC3, MP3, M4A, MKA, WAV, WMA, etc.) and advanced sound decoding technologies DTS5.1, Dolby, AAC, TrueHD, DTSHD and others.
 
 Other interesting features of the program include a virtual remote control for the media menu, support for playlists and graphic themes, allowing you to easily customize the appearance of the player to your preferences.
