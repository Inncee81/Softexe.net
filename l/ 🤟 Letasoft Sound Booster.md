Letasoft Sound Booster is a very useful application for people whose speakers (eg in a monitor or laptop) are too poor to play selected materials with satisfactory loudness.

Once installed, Letasoft Sound Booster will automatically be minimized to the system tray. By clicking on the icon of the program, we can "call" it to open a small rectangle, where the volume control will appear, like the one we know perfectly well from the Windows operating system.
 
 Letasoft Sound Booster is a tool that we will use during playing, while watching movies or using various applications (including messengers). It may turn out that after setting the volume to 100 percent, we are not able to hear everything anyway, but the program adds another volume scale (up to 500 percent!).
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 14 days.
