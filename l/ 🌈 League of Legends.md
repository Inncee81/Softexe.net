League of Legends is a MOBA (Massive Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) created based on a modification to the WarCraft III game entitled Defense of the Ancients (DotA). The production is available for free (financial model free-to-play), but offers the opportunity to buy items to use during the game for real money (micro-transactions).

The game combines RPG (role playing game) and RTS (real-time strategy) games, offering access to such modes as Summoner's Rift (the most popular option, two five-person teams fighting in the jungle), Twisted Treeline (two teams of three heroes, small skirmishes) and Howling Abyss (two five-person teams fight each other in one avenue, the key to success is cooperation). 
 
 Gameplay in League of Legends focuses on skirmishes between players in 3vs3 or 5vs5 modes, but players can start their adventure with the game by competing with opponents controlled by artificial intelligence. Before starting the game, we must choose our hero from a pool of over 110 different heroes differing not only in their appearance, but also in their skills. The battle ends when one of the participants of the game is able to destroy the enemy base.
 
 It is worth adding that in the world there are regularly organized e-sport tournaments for the League of Legends game, which in 2013 was officially recognized as a sport discipline. Professional players compete with each other for prizes of up to millions of dollars.
