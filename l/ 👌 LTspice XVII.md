LTspice is a relatively simple to use program for designing and testing analog and mixed electronics. The advantage of the program is speed, a huge library of elements and the simplicity of creating layouts.

When designing the layout, you can use the elements provided with the program, download additional elements from the Internet, enter parameters manually or design the modules yourself. In addition to the basic elements in the component library, we can also find voltage stabilizers, power sources with different functions, comparators, many types of diodes, and so on. Graphical representations of elements can be moved and rotated without losing connections, labels can also be added to the diagram and a ready drawing can be printed.
 In the system simulation mode, it is possible to check the voltage and current at various points of the system and to view changes in current parameters in the diagrams. For the basic test, it is enough to give the simulation time (in seconds), but the possibilities of the program do not end there.
