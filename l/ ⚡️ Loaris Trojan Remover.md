Thanks to the Loaris Trojan Remover, we will remove Trojan horses, malware, adware, spyware and other broadly understood viruses. The application allows you to perform a standard, full or custom scan. In the last case, it offers the possibility to define a destination that we want to check for the presence of malicious files. This is possible not only for the contents of the hard disk, but also for removable USB media or other portable memory.
 
 Loaris Trojan Remover also includes additional tools that enable, among other things, restoring the default settings of the web browser, elements related to the Windows update and HOSTS files in the operating system. The user also has the option to modify other settings (eg specify in what intervals the program is to update the malware database).
 
 Loaris Trojan Remover presents scan reports in a separate tab. You can read them directly in the program window or save them to a text file, and then - if necessary - print them.
