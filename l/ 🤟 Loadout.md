The creators came up with a similar humor to the issue of knocking out the opponents, although the camera was placed behind the back of the character, not in her head. The main feature that distinguishes the product from many others available on the Internet is the number of possible combinations of parts from which the givers are assembled. According to the creators, it is over 30 billion combinations.
 
 The player chooses from among a few basic types of weapons to modify, in order to install telescopes, larger magazines, affect the characteristics of your own rifle model or name and paint it in your own way. Naturally, we acquire new elements as you progress in the game.
 
 In Loadout, separately we determine the equipment packages, which consist of two weapons plus grenades or a first aid kit. When it comes to health, it regenerates itself. In addition, we get an advanced character editor that allows you to create almost any hero that we will eliminate rivals. You can buy additional items of clothing, but for real money. Each match is not only successive portions of the experience, but also a chance for interesting bonuses after the clash.
 
 The basic form of play includes four game modes which are variations on the subject of traditional deathmatch, fighting for the flag (here for a battle hammer) or maintaining certain positions on the map. In annihilation destined for real annihilation, elements of all other modes appear.
 
 The product can boast of very good quality graphics, with specially exaggerated and exaggerated bloody effects. The game is also accompanied by extremely dynamic music that gives the game extra flavor.
 
 Attention!
 
 In order to obtain the correct game file, you must first register on the project website and then use the Steam program - a special online platform that not only allows you to buy and download computer games, but also permanent contact with friends, which we can at any time invite to play.
