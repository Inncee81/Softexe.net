Lightroom Downloader requires logging into a Creative Cloud account. The program will check the location of the cloud occupied by our photos and let you choose a folder on the local disk where it will be saved. You need to provide the program with adequate space for files, because there is no possibility to choose which will be downloaded. 
 
 
 The library will download both the original files and previews that have been saved in the cloud.
