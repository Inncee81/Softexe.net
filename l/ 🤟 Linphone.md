> Linphone is another application that allows convenient voice communication via the Internet. Thanks to it, we will call another person using the program and send text messages to it, completely free of charge.

The program uses the open SIP protocol, thanks to which the functionality of the application is not limited only to other Linphone users - we can call anyone who has any application using this protocol. Thanks to the program, we can not only conduct voice and video calls, but also send text messages. The great advantage of Linphone is its lightness, speed of launch and low load of system resources.
 
 A problem of the program is a rather unfriendly interface, which creators make up for the fact that it does not even require initial configuration in order to be able to start a conversation with another person right after installation. The options allow you to configure many aspects of the program, such as the selection of ports to listen, audio codecs used and their quality, and sounds for individual events.
