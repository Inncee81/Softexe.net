```sh
LXtory is an interesting application of the application for taking screenshots or short GIF animations around the cursor, which then allows you to quickly share on the Web, including on the site Imgur, Dropbox, Google Drive or directly on your own FTP server. In parallel, a local copy of the dump is also created.

Like most of these types of programs, LXtory also offers discharges in several ways. You can save the area of ​​the entire monitor, the selected window or manually select the appropriate area on the screen. An option here is to record short GIFs. The characteristic feature is also the many settings that allow you to configure, among other things, the use of keyboard shortcuts.
 
 The interface's appearance is a slight minus. Readability and usability remain at a high level, but this is a rather unusual situation, when from the visual side the panel of settings in the program seems to be much more attractive than the main window. Nevertheless, the application remains completely useful.
