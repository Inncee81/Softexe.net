The application allows you to emulate over 120 musical instruments. Among them we find, among others acoustic grand piano, electric piano, harmonica, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, cello, acoustic bass, organ, many types of drums and much more. Built-in samplers also allow you to use as an instrument unusual sounds coming from public transport, sounds of birds, wind, rain, projectiles, helicopters, etc. 
 
 Each instrument can be assigned to one of ten channels. This solution allows you to use many different instruments simultaneously in created music pieces. Of course, each soundtrack is recorded separately, thus building the whole song. In addition, in the program you will find the ability to set the volume for the keybord, the tempo of playing music (BPM), Drum Pattern and Pattern Editor.
 
 Finished songs can be saved from a special format supported by the Little Piano program or exported to MIDI format. The user also has the option of overdubbing and overwriting previously created fragments of the song.
