The program is based on the AES-256 encryption algorithm and allows Windows to create a special, encrypted partition for private data. This operation is extremely simple and is based on working with the built-in wizard. In a few simple steps the user defines, among others, the size of the volume being created and the access password, which will provide us with access to the encrypted partition at a later stage. The tool allows you to create volumes of any size - from several MB, even several dozen GB. Their operation is identical to the standard disk in Windows.
 
 Lacie Private-Public is available under an open source license, does not require installation and can be used on Windows and Mac OS.
