The program allows you to create your own work from scratch, and import it from a hard disk or any other media, if you have your own project in Leonardo format, or * .leo (other extensions are not supported). The tool limits the user only in this regard. In addition, the area of ​​drawing or painting is infinite, and additional solutions effectively facilitate work.
 
 Leonardo has a very clear and easy-to-use user interface; can also boast of fast action. Available perspective tools make drawing lines and shapes in the perspective much easier. The application also facilitates stabilizing and smoothing contours with printing ink.
 
 The tablets supported by this tool include: Microsoft Surface Pro, Surface Go, Surface Book, Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga, Lenovo Miix, Huion Kamvas, Ugee, XP-Pen, Wacom Intous and Wacom Cintiq. With their help (and, of course, with the mouse) we will be able to sketch, draw and paint using available pencils or brushes.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 14 days! To use Leonardo you need to set up a free user account.
