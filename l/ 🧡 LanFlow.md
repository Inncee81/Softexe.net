> LanFlow is a tool used to create diagrams showing the configuration of various networks (not only LAN).

Thanks to this program, we can easily and quickly design the layout of a given network. The whole process will take only a few minutes after which we will be able to present the results of our work. LanFlow enables not only the placement of selected objects on the diagram (eg computers, workstations, routers, printers, file servers), but also cable connections.
 
 LanFlow offers the possibility to save created projects in EDG, WMF, EMF, BMP, JPG, PNG, TIF and GIF formats. Therefore, we can easily share diagrams with selected users, for example via e-mail or instant messenger.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
