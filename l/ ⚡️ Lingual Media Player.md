Using the tool is extremely simple. When watching a movie, just use one button to stop the material being played and repeat the last fragment or change the language of the movie; you can also jump to the selected moment and set the program to pause the picture after each sentence. Nothing prevents you from watching video and displaying subtitles in two languages ​​at the same time - original and native to the user.
