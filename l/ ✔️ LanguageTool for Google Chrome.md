Checking the spelling of the selected text
 
 LanguageTool supports over 25 different languages, among which we can find English, German, French, Spanish, Russian and Polish. It allows you to check the spelling of almost any text in a web browser - both published online and also entered by the user. Importantly, in most cases, it can detect errors that are not found by standard spell check tools.
 
 The advantage of the described tool besides the high efficiency of detecting various errors is also the ease of use. If you want to submit the selected text, it is enough to mark it and use the appropriate button or keyboard shortcut. LanguageTool by default checks every text entered and supports almost all public Internet portals and websites - including Facebook, Twitter, Linkedln, Gmail and many, many more. The extension allows to define the so-called personal dictionaries as well as excluded rules and corrections of selected URLs.
