LightZone is an open source digital darkroom program in which we will perform the necessary steps to extract the best possible images from RAW files from the camera. The program consists of a file browser and an editing module.

The LightZone file viewer allows you to navigate the directory tree, presents thumbnails of the images found in them and allows you to take a closer look at the selected images. Here we can also modify metadata, give images to the assessment and collect them in stacks. Immediately in the browser you can use the template to call the image and instantly get a JPG file with the selected effect, and also export the file collection with a slightly larger selection of parameters as JPEG or TIFF. You can also rotate the picture here. 
 
 
 
 The photo developing module allows you to perform basic activities related to improving the color, temperature of light, color mapping, color balance, blurring and sharpening the image. However, this is done in an unusual way, because applying layers with subsequent corrections and setting the masking according to brightness or shade. You can activate the preview of zones and masks above the tool panel and it is very helpful when selecting the range to which specific effects will be applied. You can also reach for the manual selection tools and determine the degree of feathering of the selected shapes. Of course, layers can be mixed in different ways, so people who are used to working with raster graphics will feel at home here. Each layer can be modified or removed at any time. 
 
 
 
 Finally, we can use the basic retouching tools. We find here classic red eye removal and removal of spot imperfections.
