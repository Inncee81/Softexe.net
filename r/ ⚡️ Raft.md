We're trapped on a small raft drifting in the ocean. We only have a hook made of old plastic. In such unfavorable conditions (in vain to look for land amidst the landscape) we must do everything to survive. First, we should take care of food and drink, so that we can later start collecting items, which - perhaps - we will be able to build something like a shelter.
 
 The mentioned hook is initially the most important piece of equipment for the main character of the game Raft, because with it we catch trash, and then choose among them what may be useful in the further part of the expedition. Raft travel alone is useless, which is why it is worth to immerse yourself in water and look for materials in the depths. However, you have to be careful, because in the ocean we can meet various predators (eg sharks).
 
 Raft includes a crafting system. The game allows you to build survival equipment, create weapons, and even allow you to grow plants. With the help of the acquired objects, we are expanding the raft, which in time becomes a great residence.
