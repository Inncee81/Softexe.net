```sh
Eliminating the next leg of the undead will probably never get bored with players, and if a well-presented MMO project is signed, signed with the name of a family well-known from film horror films, then there is a chance for a network hit. Also distributed for free. Romero's Aftermath is just such a unique offer for lonely evenings. The main task here is, of course, to survive in an open world in which a rot can come from behind any bush.

The basic thing is, of course, to create your own hero, which later in the game will be equipped with ever better weapons and occasionally modify its appearance from time to time. That a simple shooter would not come out of the game, the creators of the studio Free Reign Entertainment along with director George C. Romero devised various possibilities of influencing the world around the player. He will, among other things, clean up other towns of zombies, and then restore them to a usable state by running power generators, which is of course useful for petrol. Provided are adequate bonuses that can always steal from us before the nose others. It is also worth looking around for boxes dropped from helicopters.
 
 
 There was also a system of creating objects from the parts collected or obtained from spreading the things that are not necessary for the player. Naturally, the next diagrams needed to assemble them will have to be found by yourself. Something for fans of games in defending the base is an option to set up own camps, including setting up barricades, entanglements and traps. Just call your friends to make the outback feel familiar. Even it will be time to take care of some crops. In a free moment, well armed, you will hunt undead, and for boredom you will take duels between you.
