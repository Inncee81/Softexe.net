RenderMan is a proprietary Pixar rendering system, without which "Toy Story" or "Wall-E" would not be created. Now everyone can use it for free, unless they plan to make money on it and set up an account on the Forum - students, researchers, plugin developers and hobbyists, unless it is used for a commercial project. This version can also be used by film studios that want to test the system before they decide to buy it. Details can be found on the RenderMana website.

The recently released version 19 of the program introduced primarily the RIS framework, designed for fast ray tracing and optimized for global lighting. It will show its power when generating the image in geometrically complex stages, where hair and volumetric effects are also included. It is currently one of the fastest renderers of this type and will work well in animated films as well as in the production of special effects. Already the first iteration shows the scene with all the details, so you can stop the process relatively early if the result is not satisfactory. Mass rendering also allows you to "preview" effects at any time. We also find here a comprehensive ray tracking for the light scattering under the surface of the object (SSS / SSLT), developed by the Disney research department. Thanks to this, it is possible to render even photorealistic human skin. In addition, RIS has been equipped with a rich library of shaders, making it possible to create objects that look like real.
 
 
 RenderMana can be used to work in different environments, including KATANA and Maya programs (Houdini and Cinema4D are also in the plan). The ability to interactively render allows you to work on the lighting and the character of the scene without going too deep into technical details. Thanks to the author's method of light sampling, which consists in collecting light sources in a pool and prioritizing them on the basis of size, brightness and position in relation to the camera, the number of allowed lights in the scene increased dramatically. RenderMan can handle several thousand "light bulbs" and should not cause problems. In addition, thanks to various optimization tricks, it will save a lot of time, and time is money.
 
 
 RenderMan's capabilities were appreciated by many filmmakers, who not only deal with animated productions. Thanks to him in the action scenes in "Final Fantasy VIII" there was an effective blur background, in the "Guardians of the Galaxy" Marvel's world of comics gained a new life, the Titanic broke spectacularly, and the One Ring fell into the fire of Mount Doom. 
 
 
 The non-commercial RenderMan has all the options for a paid version and there are no time limits or watermarks. Open standards, used in the animation and generation of effects: Alembic, OpenColorIO, OpenEXR, OpenSubdiv, OpenVDB, OSL, RSL, SeExpr, Ptex, UDIM, USD and others found their place here.
