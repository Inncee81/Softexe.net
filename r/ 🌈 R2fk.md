R2fk enables accounting in the form of full accounting or, optionally, in the form of a book of revenues and expenditures, or a flat-rate register of revenues, creation of VAT purchase and sale registers as well as storing information on fixed assets and equipment of the company.
 
 The application allows you to print all the necessary declarations and applications to the Tax Office (VAT-7, VAT-7K, VAT-7D, VAT-12, VAT-EU with attachments VAT-UE / A and VAT-UE / B, VAT-UEK , VAT-R, VAT-Z, PIT-36L, PIT-28, PIT-28 / A, PIT-28 / B). On their basis, it will automatically transfer receivables to the US and ZUS (the possibility of adapting the program to work with any banking system). With the help of R2fk we settle the inventory, payments along with charging default interest, exchange differences on currency payments, calculating the margin, and we will prepare a monthly / quarterly statement of income tax due.
 
 The program can also be successfully used by accounting offices. He can handle many entities with various forms of accounting - from full accounting, through the book of revenues and expenses, to a lump sum. It offers control of entering and correcting data by different users, regular printing of VAT-7 declarations or serial sending of VAT-7 e-statements, notifying customers via e-mail about the amount of taxes payable for a given period and enables sending all printouts via e-mail in HTML or PDF.
 
 Importantly, R2fk is fully compliant with the latest tax regulations. In particular, with Article 89b of the amended VAT Act (imposing an obligation to correct VAT included in operating expenses, from invoices if we do not pay for these invoices within 150 days from the date of payment), and also Article 24d of the Income Tax Act natural persons and article 15b of the amended Corporate Income Tax Act (imposing the obligation to adjust the tax deductible costs resulting from overdue purchase invoices.) The adjustment should be made if the obligation is not paid, within 30 days of the payment deadline - if the payment deadline does not exceed 60 days - or 90 days from the date of being credited to costs - if the payment deadline is longer than 60 days).
 
 Attention!
 
 The demo version has all the features of the full version. The only restriction is blocking printouts and exporting data after 60 days from the date of installation.
