The tool checks, among others running processes, services, loaded DLLs and entries in the system registry, displaying at the end a list of suspicious applications. RogueKiller is doing very well to remove both malicious software that runs automatically through registry entries as well as startup folders or the master boot record. The application generates a report of its work in the form of a text file, which by default is saved on the system desktop.
 
 RogueKiller also offers the functions of reading and repairing the host file, proxy servers and dns entered into system entries as well as corrupted application shortcuts. Threats are detected mainly on the basis of black and white lists, but the program also offers a heuristic malware detection module.
 Attention!
 
 We only recommend working with the tool for advanced users.
 Before launching RogueKiller, it is recommended to close running programs - including antivirus software.
