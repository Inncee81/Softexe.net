Rufus is a small utility for formatting and creating bootable USB-drives, as well as USB keys and memory cards. Unlike similar programs, Rufus  works much faster and will be useful in cases where:


you need to create USB installation media with the download of ISO images (Windows, Linux, UEFI, etc.),
you must work on a device that does not have an operating system installed,
need to flash the BIOS or create other DOS firmware,
run low-level utilities.
