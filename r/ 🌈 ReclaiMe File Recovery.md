The program allows you to recover data from various media and offers the opportunity to view the preview of recovered data even if the restore operation has not yet been completed. ReclaiMe File Recovery supports not only hard disks installed in the computer casing, but also memories that communicate with the device via USB, memory cards, RAID arrays and NAS disks. Importantly, the user does not need to have specialist knowledge to be able to use this tool - it is characterized by easy handling.
 
 Noteworthy is also support for various file systems: FAT, exFAT, NTFS and ReFS (used mainly in Windows), EXT2, EXT3, EXT4 and XFS (Linux, NAS), BTRFS (especially used in modern devices NETGEAR ReadyNAS), and HFS , HFS + and UFS (Macs and iPods). It is worth adding, however, that ReclaiMe File Recovery works only on Windows operating systems.
