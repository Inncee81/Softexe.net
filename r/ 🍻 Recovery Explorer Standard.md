During everyday work, we can quickly lose valuable data. Sometimes it happens that we will remove them completely by accident, otherwise the hard disk will refuse to be obedient, and besides, there is no shortage of situations in which our computer will be infected with the virus. Fortunately, however, you can remedy this by installing an appropriate program, such as the Recovery Explorer Standard.
 
 Recovery Explorer Standard has been equipped with a modern, clear user interface. All you have to do is specify the scan location (for example, partition C on the hard disk) and click the magnifying glass button at the top of the screen. The tool also allows you to manage partitions, and also allows you to create a backup. In addition, it displays detailed information about the partition, file system, capacity of the media and more.
 
 Recovery Explorer Standard supports various file formats, which is why it will restore deleted documents, photos, videos, songs, e-mails, ZIP archives, executable files, ISO images and many, many more. Interestingly, the application will recover data from both HDD and external hard drives, memory cards, portable devices or pendrives.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version of Recovery Explorer Standard allows you to save recovered files whose capacity does not exceed 256 KB.
