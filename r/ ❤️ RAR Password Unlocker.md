In order to prevent access to RAR archives to outsiders, we often secure them using a password. Sometimes, however, there may be a situation in which we forget what string of characters we protect our data and we will not be able to open the necessary documents ourselves. At this moment, it is worth using RAR Password Unlocker, a program that will solve the problem.
 
 The password can be retrieved in one of three ways: brute-force attack (tests all possible combinations of passwords), brute-force attack with masking (highly recommended option, which significantly shortens the time of data recovery, specifying the length of the forgotten password, character set , etc.), as well as a dictionary attack (looking for a possible password in the dictionary, an option only useful if our password was a standard word, not an accidental string of numbers and letters). 
 
 It is worth noting that the tool allows you to automatically shut down your computer after the recovery operation. It is also possible to stop the program and resume it at any time by using the automatic save function.
