The software is targeted rather to novice users, but it can also help the work of webmasters and people involved in optimization and positioning. With its help, we will check the position of the selected website in search engines for a given phrase, as well as compare the results with competing websites with similar topics, but not only.
 
 After the analysis, the Rapid SEO Tool displays a report containing detailed information on the so-called Page Rank, the number of words indexed for a given site, the number of errors detected during validation of W3C or the position of our website in search engines (Google, Bing, Yahoo!) for a specific keyword. The tool also gives you the option of browsing the indicated URL in Spider View mode and, what the novice webmasters will appreciate, provides useful tips on how to increase the position of our website in search engines. 
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to run the program 30 times.
