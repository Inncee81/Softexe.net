The tool offers support for the above-mentioned services, allowing you to use them using one application with a compact user interface. In addition to supporting sending and receiving text messages, Ripcord also allows voice chat. At the same time, it is worth noting that the program described here uses computer resources to a negligible extent, so it can be successfully installed on older machines as well.
 
 Ripcord allows you to log in to multiple accounts and open several windows, so that we can simultaneously conduct conversations with various people (also on more than one monitor). There is a function of adding selected channels to bookmarks in order to run the most frequently visited profiles faster.
 
 Interestingly, Ripcord offers the function of resizing, type and color of the font. This means that we can customize the display of text in messages to your preferences.
