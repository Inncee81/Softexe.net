The program was created in the form of a clear wizard that will guide you through the whole process. At the beginning, we need to select a specific partition or hard drive that we want to scan in order to find the data. Then click the "continue" button to start analyzing the content of the indicated area or media, which can be very time-consuming depending on the volume of the volume or the entire HDD.
 
 When the scan is completed, Raise Data Recovery will display detailed information about the data we can recover. They are presented in the form of a transparent directory tree, where you just select the appropriate data and use the "recover selected" option, which will restore documents, photos, videos, executable files, ZIP archives and more.
