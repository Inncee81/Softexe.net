Review Toolbar is an add-on for LibreOffice and OpenOffice packages, which facilitates access to reviewing functions. Thanks to it, on one toolbar there are functions such as the ability to place a note, highlighter and record changes.

The add-on does not provide new functions, but only collects those useful when reviewing documents in one place. The toolbar has functions usually arranged in different menu sections. On the bar you will find the option of tracking changes in the document, protecting the list of changes, accepting changes and highlighting them, attaching comments to changes, inserting annotations to the location of the cursor, delineating text, enabling line numbering, and of course, cleaning the document before publishing.
