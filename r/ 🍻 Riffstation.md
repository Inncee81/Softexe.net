Riffstation is an application that is supported by Fender, supporting learning to play the guitar (not only electric and any producer). On the basis of any downloaded song, the program automatically proposes chords that will be suitable for playing it and can display them on the fly during playback.

However, this functionality does not end there. The application also allows you to change the tempo and tone and finally to mute selected parts of instruments, for example to distinguish a guitar solo (to make it easier to learn), or on the contrary - mute them to play them alone against the other instruments in the song.
 
 The program took care of details. For example, the user can change the color of the virtual guitar's fretboard to match that of the real instrument.
