The program interface was created on the basis of the GTK library, and thus is characterized by an archaic appearance, whose advantages are simplicity, convenience and speed of action. The main window has been divided into three parts, which are responsible for displaying the calendar, tagged clouds, searched items, user entries and trees with categories. RedNotebook gives the possibility of basic formatting of the entered texts. It is possible, among others bolding, underlining, skewing and crossing the font. In addition, each entry may contain graphics, files, links, bulleted lists, etc. In turn, the template function allows you to organize the layout and content of the entered data.
 
 RedNotebook offers autosave functions, which operation allows you to automatically save data when closing the program, as well as during their editing at certain intervals. Both the entire contents of the database, as well as texts from selected days can be saved to the text file format, HTML, Latex or PDF. In addition, the application allows you to create backup copies that have the form of ZIP archives.
