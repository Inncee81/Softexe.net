The desktop application interface is based on three columns: a category panel (passwords, payments, both categories), a panel with a list of stored data (at the bottom, a plus button that allows adding more) and a preview of the data itself. Such an arrangement is associated with the address book and is very clear.
 
 In the manager version it is possible to import data stored by other programs: you can download passwords and card data from Chrome as well as other password managers, eg LastPass. You can also install the Chrome browser extension from the program settings. The developers of the program also plan to provide the WebExtension extension for Firefox.
 
 RememBear allows you to store login data for websites and payment card data - you can filter the list by selecting the appropriate item. Adding additional devices to the manager can be done with a QR code. The data sent is encrypted using an end-to-end method with a 256-bit key.
