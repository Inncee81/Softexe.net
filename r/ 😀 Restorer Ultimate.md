After you run Restorer Ultimate, point to the specified hard disk, partition, or external storage medium. Only now we have to choose the option of locating files that can be recovered. If they have not been found, we should try to conduct an in-depth scan. Performing these operations is not problematic, because the program works in the form of a transparent wizard, thanks to which less experienced users will also manage the Restorer Ultimate service.
 
 Restorer Ultimate in the version for Windows operating systems supports the following file systems: FAT / FAT16 / FAT32 / exFAT / NTFS / NTFS5 and ReFS. In addition, we can also find data from the RAID array with an intuitive wizard, automatic recognition of RAID 5 and RAID 6 parameters, consistency control and many other solutions.
 
 It is worth mentioning that Restorer Ultimate allows you to recover files and folders on your computer, where it has been installed, and also offers the possibility of working in remote mode.
