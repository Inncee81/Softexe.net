```sh
RPCS3 is an open source emulator of the PlayStation 3 console. It has been developing since 2011, currently supports modern DirectX12 and Vulkan renderers, allowing you to run an increasing number of games for this machine - if we have a computer with at least Core i5 Sandy Bridge (or equivalent to AMD) - it would be important to support SSE3 extensions, 4 GB RAM and a GeForce 400 or Radeon HD5000 graphics card.

The emulator should be obtained from your Sony firmware console (the latest version allows you to install it from the PS3UPDAT.PUP distribution file). Simple homebrew games on PS3 can be found, for example, at Brewology . Of course, commercial games should be purchased and then downloaded to the ISO image.
 
 Including PPU Interpreter (precise) and SPU Interpreter (precise) in the options allows more precise emulation, but works slower. Faster emulation can be achieved by setting PPU Interpreter (fast) and SPU Interpreter (fast). If the game works with fast interpreter enabled, it can be further accelerated, including PPU Recompiler and SPU Recompiler.
 You should not use graphics settings other than FullHD (1920 × 1080) and HD (1280 × 720), the FPS limit should be left on Auto, the Read / Write Color / Depth buffers should remain disabled, they do not work correctly yet.
 
 You can find more information on the project's website . Note: the emulator on Windows requires the installation of Visual C ++ 2015 libraries
