After starting Recordify, we need to log in to your account in one of the above-mentioned services in order to download selected songs. The tool saves music to MP3, WAV and FLAC formats. The files can then be put in the memory of the selected mobile device (smartphone or tablet) to enjoy access to them outside the home in offline mode.
 
 Interestingly, Recordify also allows you to record all sounds coming from, for example, computer speakers, which can be useful when you start any song from another source. To use this option, however, a Firefox or Chrome web browser is required.
