The creators have in an interesting way combined the aspects of comics with the real world. The elaborate and rather peculiar characters take part in an action in the area of ​​several well-known global metropolises (New York, San Francisco, London) ruined by a series of inexplicable cataclysms.
 
 Destruction is always accompanied by the so-called cube effect, which, as it turns out later, has a connection with the Incarnations that are more and more common in the world - people with special skills and abilities derived from demons, spiritual manifestations of the existence of gods, monsters and other beings from ancient mythology. Their supernatural powers do not match the outside world and arouse the fear of society ...
 
 The quintessence of the game is the division into two teams of two players. Different types of heroes fight each other for dominance, while trying to achieve specific goals of the match. Each winning exit from the duel enriches us with further experience points. During the competition, we will use weapons straight from science fiction movies and other attributes of previously unknown human civilization. An important element of each encounter is to make the title of the incarnation at the right moment, which will bring the victory to a large extent. The correct choice of the hero is also important, because each of them has different abilities, a unique style of fighting and action, and an individual set of deadly combos.
 
 Rise of Incarnates has a good audio-visual setting enriched with a number of spectacular attacks, explosions, explosions and other special effects. Each character is in some way "exaggerated" and exaggerated with the intention of displaying its main features, which adds a bit of a comic-caricature aftertaste to the game.
 
 This grotesque atmosphere of the game perfectly adapts to the general convention of fun, but it is fun, immersive, and also forcing team play. Thanks to the high playability and dynamism of the game, the title should attract not only fans of the genre to the computer.
 
 Attention!
 In order to install the game, you should download the Steam program - a special online platform that allows you not only to buy and download computer games, but also to offer players the opportunity to contact each other, exchange experiences and play together.
 The title is still in the production phase, but during the game we have not encountered any serious errors that prevent or hinder the game.
