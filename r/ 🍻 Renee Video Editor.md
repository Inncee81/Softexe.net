The program's interface is based on tiles, so all basic options are available at your fingertips. Renee Video Editor supports the most popular file formats, such as: AVI, MP4, M4A and many more. We can not only delete certain parts of films (individually or in batch mode), but also apply various effects, add soundtrack and subtitles, rotate video, combine several materials or divide one large file into several smaller ones.
 
 While modifying the appearance of the film, the changes are presented in real time. It turns out to be extremely useful when, thanks to the Renee Video Editor, we improve, for example, brightness, contrast and saturation of the image, or add graphic filters. Interestingly, after finishing work, we can protect the video with a watermark in the entire movie or, for example, only at the beginning.
