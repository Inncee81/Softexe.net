In fact, we are dealing here with a set of emulators of various consoles. With the help of RetroArch, we can run games from the first PlayStation, Gameboy, Nintendo 64, Segi Dreamcast and Segi Saturn. The interface of the described tool is very modern and transparent (in a sense it refers to the GUI known from the PlayStation 3 console). After the menu, we can move not only with the mouse but also with the keyboard. At the same time, the authors made sure that the player could decide which options and elements should appear on the screen. Thanks to this, you can customize the appearance of individual program windows to your preferences.
 
 RetroArch goes with the times, so in emulators we will find the possibility of transmitting your game live via Twitch TV or YouTube. In addition, during the game we will unlock numerous achievements, which at the time of the premiere of the classics launched with the use of this tool simply was not in the world yet (RetroArch integrates with the well-known portal RetroAchievements).
