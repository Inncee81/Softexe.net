Recycle Bin Recovery is a data recovery tool. Thanks to it, we will restore files even if they have been removed from the recycle bin of the Windows operating system.

After starting Recycle Bin Recovery, select the appropriate hard drive or partition (NTFS or FAT) on it, and then click "next". The tool will then start analyzing the content of the indicated area on the HDD to later display a list of files that we can recover. A very transparent wizard means that we do not have to have specialized knowledge and we can restore lost data relatively quickly and easily.
 
 Recycle Bin Recovery also includes an additional work mode that allows you to recover files from formatted hard drives of any size (there are no restrictions in this respect, which means that the application also greatly recovers data placed on carriers with a capacity of many terabytes) .
