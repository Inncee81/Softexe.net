RainWallpaper is a very interesting application, thanks to which we will change the wallpaper on the desktop of the Windows operating system.

Of course, this is not a mere substitution of any picture. RainWallpaper is something much more and allows you to put on the screen two-dimensional as well as three-dimensional graphics, various animations, the content of a given website, video materials and many, many more.
 
 RainWallpaper allows you to easily and quickly download wallpapers from the built-in online gallery. You can also create your own works and then share them through the well-known DeviantArt service.
 
 For a wallpaper to be displayed all the time, RainWallpaper must work in the background. In this case, it's worth adding that the program consumes very little computer resources (CPU and RAM), so you do not have to worry about the drastic drop in PC performance after turning on the 3D wallpaper.
