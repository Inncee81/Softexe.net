Before starting your adventure with Ravenfield it is worth bearing in mind that the game was created by a single independent SteelRaven7 studio, and Johan Hassel is responsible for everything we see on the screen. The title offers both the campaign and the Instant Action mode, in which after defining several parameters (map, rules of the game, etc.), we can immediately start playing.
 
 Ravenfield lets you join a team of celestial players whose goal is to deal with the red units. There are many different extermination tools available (eg pistols) and various types of transport facilitating navigation around the map (including tanks and helicopters).
 
 The mechanics of the Ravenfield game were designed in such a way that the first violin would only play the skills of the person sitting in front of the monitor, and the contents of the equipment were of secondary importance.
