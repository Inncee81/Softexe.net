> Raven is a desktop RSS reader with the necessary options and a very readable user interface.

After starting the tool, we can add the selected RSS feed by entering the website address (eg dobreprogramy.pl), thanks to which Raven will automatically download the latest information published by the website, which will then be presented in the middle window of the program. The right, the largest page, allows you to read individual messages, descriptions and other materials.
 
 Raven not only allows you to view all entries published on a given page, but also offers the function of adding selected content to favorites and the option to save articles (you can later read them offline). 
 
 Raven also allows you to import and export a list of RSS feeds.
