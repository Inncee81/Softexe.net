The software was created to support technical education around the world. It is intended mainly for younger audiences - primary and junior high school students, allowing them to learn the basics of programming. Work, and in principle learning with the program is done by controlling the robot, which is tasked to perform various activities on the board.
 
 RoboMind is based on the proprietary ROBO programming language, which has basic and concise rules. The tool allows you to create simple scripts, in which the basic operations of the robot are carried out by functions - for example, pick up, in, forward, etc. The environment teaches logical thinking and problem solving that can be encountered in everyday life and industry.
 
 Attention!
 
 The environment can be used for programming LEGO Mindstorms NXT robots.
