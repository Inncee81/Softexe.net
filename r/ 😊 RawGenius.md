The tool has been optimized for creating RTN / RTK measurement reports for geodetic documentation centers. The generated report is in line with the draft G-1.12 guidelines, it can be easily adapted to the specific requirements of the center or the user's needs.
 
 RawGenius contains several additional functions that significantly increase the usability of the program, including averaging multiple measurements, a combination of control measurement points, quality control of points, a report of the location, handling points measured "on the counts", the ability to correct incorrectly entered pitch heights.
 
 The appearance of the report can be customized to your own needs, you can create your own report templates and generate "traditional" text reports or table-formatted reports (HTML). The resulting coordinates can be displayed in Google Earth, previewed or further processed in GeoView, or simply saved to a text file with location and altitude errors.
 
 The program can act as a C-GEO plugin, which allows you to easily save the resulting coordinates to the work table and save the report directly in the C-GEO report module. In turn, Winkalk users will appreciate the ability to export vectors and base stations to the alignment module.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
