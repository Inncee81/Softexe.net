You can start the recording operation with just one button and end it in the same way. Rylstim Screen Recorder offers the option of selecting the monitor from which the image is to be captured (obviously in a situation where we have more than one screen), image resolution, video codec, frame rate and allows you to specify the path in which you want to save the created material video. The program also allows you to define whether the application should also register information about the use of the right and left mouse buttons.
 
 It is worth noting that Rylstim Screen Recorder does not require specialized skills, and the configuration of individual options should not cause problems even to less experienced users.
