What distinguishes Revo Uninstaller Pro from the built-in applet "Add / Remove programs" offered in Windows is primarily the speed of action and a few additional tools to supplement the application uninstallation. Among them you can find the Auto-Start system manager, the function of removing unnecessary files left after installing the programs, cleaning the browser history, the Office package and the option of irreversibly deleting files and folders.
 
 Another interesting option offered by Revo Uninstaller Pro is the so-called hunter mode, thanks to which the application is able to recognize itself, after pointing to the icon of a program, how to uninstall it. The Pro version also offers the function of backup of performed activities and support for 64-bit systems.
