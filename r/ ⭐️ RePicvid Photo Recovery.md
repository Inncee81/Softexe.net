The program is addressed to both less and more experienced users. In order to try to recover the lost data, it is enough to specify the place which the program should scan to locate the deleted files, and then become familiar with the effects of such a scan and indicate the data we want to restore. Then there's nothing else we can do to save them on the computer again.
 
 The list of formats supported by RePicvid Photo Recovery looks very impressive. The tool supports both graphics (JPG / JPEG, TIFF / TIF, PNG, ICO, BMP, GIF, PSD, CRW, CR2, CDR, NEF, ORF, RAF, SR2, MRW, DCR, WMF, NEF, EXIF, RAW, SVG , HDRI, TGA, EXIF, FPX, CAM), video materials (AVI, MOV, MP4, M4V, 3GP, 3G2, WMV, ASF, FLV, SWF, MPG / MPEG, RM / RMVB, MKV, MXF) as well as audio files (IF / AIFF, M4A, MP3, WAV, WMA, APE, MID / MIDI, OGG, AAC, RealAudio).
 
 It is worth using this program if you accidentally deleted your data or lost it as a result of virus attack or hardware failure. RePicvid Photo Recovery deals with restoring files placed not only on the computer's hard drive, but also on other media. The application supports SSD, external HDD, pendrives, memory cards, MP3 and MP4 players, digital cameras (including Canon, Sony, Nikon and Panasonic) and micro SD cards placed in telephones.
