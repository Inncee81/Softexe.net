Ron's Renamer is a surprisingly advanced tool designed to massively rename files and folders, using a variety of available options and capabilities.

At first glance, the application window is certainly not overly pleasant, as a large number of possibilities is represented by a certain mess in the interface to which you have to get used to. Once you get used to it, you can start to appreciate the various options of the application, which allow you to change the names of virtually any number of files using the sets of "rules", or rules. We can add text, numbers, date, delete spaces to names, use metatags (e.g. song names or image data), reverse text, and more. The number of possibilities and possible combinations is really big.
 
 Thanks to the upper part of the program window, we can not only easily find ourselves in the directory structure like in an ordinary Windows Explorer, but also preview the new file names, so we make sure that we achieve the desired effect. An additional advantage of Ron's Renamer is the possibility of withdrawing the changes, but if we think that the new file names do not suit us for some reason.
 
 Attention!
 
 Lite version of the application allows you to change the names of 75 files and does not support the command line and shortcuts to specific rules.
 It is possible to activate the Pro version, which has a limitation of action up to 30 days after activation.
