The program has been equipped with modern technology to protect the computer in real time, as well as an advanced scanner for detecting and removing various pests. It offers a simple and clear interface and simplicity to use. It has three different scanning modes - fast, free and full. After completing the scan, it displays a detailed list of detected threats, which we can then quickly remove completely from the hard disk. 
 
 
 Antivirus software also uses a special feature (Rising Cloud Security), which runs suspicious files or applications in an isolated virtual environment, where it thoroughly analyzes and checks whether they pose a threat to the operating system. The program automatically captures and removes all viruses when they are detected when you open files or archived data downloaded from the Internet.  
 
 
 Rising Antivirus checks and protects all incoming messages with attached attachments electronically, as well as ensures security when browsing the web and when connecting data media through the USB output.
