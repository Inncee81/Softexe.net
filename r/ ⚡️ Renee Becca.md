This program has been equipped with a very clear interface based on tabs. From the main window, we can choose one of the basic functionalities (backup, restore and cloning), as well as gain access to additional tools for disk management, HDD removal or a designated partition. It is also possible to recover data without a backup, but in this case the authors direct the user to the Renee Undeleter page from which the application can be downloaded.
 
 Renee Becca allows you to clone your chosen partition, hard drive or folder in three simple steps, so we'll create a back-up of smaller or larger amounts of data, and even the entire Windows. Interestingly, the program also allows you to move the operating system to an SSD drive, and in this case also the entire operation boils down to just a few steps. It is worth remembering that Renee Becca does not require any special knowledge on the part of the user.
 
 In the case of Renee Becca, of course, manual backups are possible, but the tool can also work according to a predetermined schedule. To save time and space, the application compares the contents of the backup and hard disk so as not to copy the same documents again, but only recently modified files.
 
 Attention!
 
 A free license for the above program can be obtained from the manufacturer's website .
