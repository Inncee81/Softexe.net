Unlike other applications of this type, it has a completely different principle of operation. During the work, the program generates a report containing detailed information about detected pests and then sends it to the producer. After all irregularities are analyzed by specialists, a special file is sent to the user to clean the computer from previously detected malware.
 
 The program allows detecting threats run when the operating system starts and scanning the entire contents of the disk (or files indicated by the user) in search of any infection. After completing the search, the user has the option of deleting detected components, and if he is unsure if they are not, for example, important system files, the program will display statistics from his database that will help in making decisions. In extreme cases, we can send the file to the manufacturer for analysis.
 
 It is worth noting that RegRun Reanimator should not be used as antivirus software, but only as its supplement, providing protection against new, often unidentified pests.
