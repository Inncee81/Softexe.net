As Razer Comms was created for fans of electronic entertainment, it works always on top, which means that players no longer have to switch to the messenger with the "alt + tab" keys to send a message to other people. The big advantage of the described application is also the fact that it downloads the minimum number of resources, so it does not slow down the running of the game.
 
 
 Razer Comms offers not only the chat option, but also allows you to read the history of conversations, as a result, we do not miss any entries (eg those that we did not see during the game). We can, therefore, take a screenshot of an exciting match and share it with a friend who will review our screenshot later.
 
 
 To facilitate the use of Razer Comms during the game, the manufacturer made it possible to create keyboard shortcuts for almost every feature offered by the program. Therefore, for example, we can start a chat with other members of our clan in the blink of an eye to discuss the strategy for the next game, or join a selected group of users.
 
 
 Many times during network games players can hit onerous people, which is why in Razer Comms there is an option to silence the voice of selected users. At the same time, the application allows you to adjust the volume, add and delete friends.
 
 
 Razer Comms takes care of users' safety by hiding their computer IP address and protecting against stalking and DDOS attacks.
