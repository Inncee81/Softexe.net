```sh
Red Eclipse is a multiplatform, free FPS game based on the Cube 2 engine, deliberately reminiscent of such titles as Quake III Arena or Cube 2: Sauerbraten; and as in it, the first thing that captivates in Red Eclipse is dynamics, energy and, above all, smoothness of the game.

Another similarity with which we will meet in Red Eclipse is its ease of use. Already at the first turn-on, we quickly start to orientate ourselves in the structure of the game. It has a transparent menu and an understandable interface even for less experienced players. We easily track one of several available modes and choose the one in which we feel like a small demolition.
 
 You can choose: Edit mode, where you can create your own worlds and compete with your friends, Campaign - as yet unrecognized by the creators, limited only to aimlessly finish an infinite number of opponents, Deatchmatch or total riot without unnecessary planning - the most important would be keep alive for the longest time and eliminate as many opponents as possible from a specific board. Then Capture-the-Flag and Defend-the-Flag or fun with capturing and defending the flag. In addition to these classic modes, there are two unique, Time-Trial and Bomber-Ball, where two rival teams each set a time bomb for each other to quickly eliminate members of the enemy team.
 
 In addition, it is worth noting that each of these modes can be freely mutated, for example by limiting equipment only to the sword or the rocket launcher itself, we can also join the team if the main mode does not predict it or force the game "one on one". You can also create your own combinations of modes enriching them with specific, interesting additions. For example, we choose Deatchmatch, in which besides the classic opponents there are ubiquitous, armed undeads, which can only be eliminated by a proper shot in the head or Capture-the Flag, where we also move with the help of a jetpack. 
 
 Red Eclipse was dressed in pretty good graphics, and the whole is accompanied by a distinctive and robust soundtrack that warms up competition and duels. The audiovisual setting of the game obviously deviates from the latest items promoted by commercial companies or even from other outstanding freewer titles, but it may be pleasing, and fans of FPS games should enjoy themselves.
