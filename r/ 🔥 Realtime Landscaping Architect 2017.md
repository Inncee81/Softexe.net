> Realtime Landscaping Architect 2016 is a great program for designing lawns, arbors, terraces, patios, pools, ponds, cascades, driveways, fences, rebates and many other garden elements. The program takes into account the climate zone, terrain and helps plan the irrigation system.

Realtime Landscaping Architect contains all the tools needed to prepare a garden plan, 3D presentation (in the form of images, films or VR applications) and CAD projects needed for implementation. Plans can be drawn by hand, using the provided textures of materials and models of various objects. We find here gazebos, hurdles, elements of driveways and fences and a collection of plants with the possibility of visualizing their growth and appearance in different seasons. The program also allows you to import models and sketches from DWG, DXF, SKP, 3DS and PDF files. To help you design, you can also import garden photos. 
 
 
 The great advantage of the program is the ability to switch between the top view and 3D visualization at any time. The finished plan, along with a list of materials and plants, can be printed on any paper format, from A4 to A0, using metric and imperial measures. You can also stylize your designs by adding your own studio logo, for example.
 
 
 The trial version of the program has all the features you need, but its plant and object library is poorer than the full version. In addition, a water spot will appear on the images and movies. Projects prepared in the trial version of the program can be imported into full after buying the license.
