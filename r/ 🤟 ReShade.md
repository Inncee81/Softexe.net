There are a number of various graphic additions, such as ambient occlusion, real depth of field effects, advanced SMAA antialiasing based on deep edge detection, chromatic aberration, automatic saturation and color correction, cross processing and more. 
 
 The authors of the ReShade program also provided ReShade FX, which is their own shading language and transcompiler, the syntax of which is based on HLSL. It adds various functions that facilitate work on the effects of post-processing.
