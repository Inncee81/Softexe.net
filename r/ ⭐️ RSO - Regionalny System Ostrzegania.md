The application informs the user about messages issued by the Provincial Crisis Management Centers (WCZK). They can refer to general threats, meteorological, hydrological, road and water status. It is possible to choose the type of message and from what region the information is to be provided - one, several provinces or the whole country. RSO - Regional Warning System also has the option of geolocation, which allows transfer of alarm warnings and messages appropriate for the current location of the user.
 
 In the RSO application you can also use a rich library of guides to dealing with crisis situations or in the face of a threat. They are formulated in a possibly simple and easy to understand way, constantly updated and made available to users without the need to update the mobile application.
