From the main window of the program, you can select a quick or full scan of the selected partition, scanning the entire hard disk and creating an image. The last feature allows you to make a backup, which can be a good move when you are afraid that you will lose valuable documents. However, if this is the case, we must use the remaining solutions.
 
 Before you start working with Renee Undeleter, it's worth remembering that if we decide to scan the whole hard drive, this operation can take several hours. In addition to the ability to recover data from HDD (including the system basket), the application also recovers data from memory cards and even Android smartphones.
 
 Attention!
 The trial version allows you to recover files whose size does not exceed 20 MB.
