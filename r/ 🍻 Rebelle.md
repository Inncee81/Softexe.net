```sh
Rebelle is a painting program on a computer using natural imitation tools. Its creators ensure that they have managed to develop the best algorithms on the market that reflect the behavior, flow and spontaneity of traditional materials. The strongest point of Rebelle is the simulation of materials that are water-based. Watercolor and mascaras can be dried, and then wet again and smudged, which gives unusual effects and a sense of having real tools in your hands. You can even tilt the sketchbook and watch how the water flows down, taking with you a bit of paint.

The program also allows you to combine wet and dry tools and painting on layers, which can then be applied to each other in 23 ways. Of course, there is good support for Wacom graphics tablets, although it is limited to reading pressure.
 
 
 
 Rebelle provides users with watercolors, acrylic paints, pastels, pencils, ink pen, markers, airbrush and eraser, as well as several types of paper for drawing and painting. In addition, the materials can be dried, drained, wetted again, smudged in several ways and, of course, the color can be taken from the appropriate point with the sampler. Mixing colors can also take place in several ways, and your favorite colors can be saved in a palette. The program interface is very simple and even novice users should not have problems with it. 
 
 
 The trial version of Rebelle is very limited. The program allows you to test all tools, but we can paint for 30 days only on one type of paper with the program logo in the middle. 
 
 
 The producer of the program is still experimenting with new solutions. Painting with tools from Rebelle is also possible in the browser on the website of the program completely free. Unfortunately, it requires Java.
