With the help of RadiAnt DICOM Viewer we can use many useful functions that enable image processing and measurements, such as: zooming and panning, setting brightness and contrast, negative mode, default window settings for computed tomography (eg pulmonary and bone), rotating by 90 or 180 degrees, mirroring (both in portrait and landscape), checking the angle (normal and Cobb angle) and many more.
 
 It is worth mentioning that RadiAnt DICOM Viewer can work in two modes: 32-bit and 64-bit. On the older computers, the first of these versions runs, while on newer computers we can make use of the second edition.
 
 RadiAnt DICOM Viewer will work without any problems on old PCs with only 512 MB of operating memory, but the program also uses modern equipment equipped with multi-core processors and several GB of RAM.
