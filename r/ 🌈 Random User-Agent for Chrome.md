> Random User-Agent for Chrome is a small addition to the title Google Chrome browser, increasing the anonymity of the user by randomly changing information contained in the User-Agent header, and thus related to the operating system, browser version and more.

During everyday use of the add-on, the user does not have to be interested in his work, but if you want to adjust the details to your own needs, it is worth checking the settings. Here it is possible, inter alia, to set the time interval, what information in the header will be changed and, if necessary, indicate your own information to be found there.
 
 You can also look at the settings at the beginning, because it is possible to mark ready-made examples of information about browsers and systems from which the application draws headline entries. Interestingly, only three out of a dozen or so are available by default - increasing their number, and increasing the randomness of information that represents us on the Web, which may contribute to greater anonymity.
