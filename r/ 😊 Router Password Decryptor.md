The program allows you to recover all the most important data that is required to configure the router, and thus connect to, for example, the Internet or home wireless network. For this purpose, it is required to have access to the router configuration file, in which Router Password Decryptor will automatically search for the appropriate information and then decrypt it, thus enabling its reading.
 
 The current version of the tool officially supports routers from Cisco, Juniper, DLink and BSNL. In addition, it has a 'Smart Mode' mode, which allows you to attempt to recover data from third-party devices if we have their configuration files (only the XML format is supported). The recovered information can be saved to the disk in the form of a text file, HTML, CSV or XML.
 
 Attention!
 
 Due to the functionality offered by the tool, it can be detected by antivirus software as potentially harmful and threatening our security, but it is in fact completely safe.
 The program installation wizard offers you the option of installing additional components, but you can omit this operation by clicking on the 'Decline' option.
