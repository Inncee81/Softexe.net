RegCool is a tool that is used to search for entries in the Windows registry. It can be an alternative to the registry editor built into the operating environment.

After starting the program, you get the impression that you are in the Windows Operating System Explorer - all due to a very similar user interface. The left side contains catalogs of the register presented in the form of a "tree", while the right offers the opportunity to learn about individual keys and values.
 
 RegCool allows you to repeatedly undo and redo operations, search and overwrite data, compare entries in the registry, cut, copy and paste data. It is also possible to create a backup and restore the data if necessary (eg user error).
