> Reason is a very complex, virtual recording studio used to create music on a computer. It has all the tools (instruments, effects, modules) that are necessary to record, compose and mix various sounds.

The most important feature of Reason is a stand equipped with instruments and effects that can be added and removed from the stand using a special program option. Thanks to that we will adjust the contents of the stand to your own preferences and we will have access to the necessary tools at your fingertips. When we finish work on our work, an advanced sound editor will be extremely useful, which will allow you to detect any malfunctions or unnecessary pauses.
 
 The authors of the Reason program provide users with a six-channel mixer, samplers, synthesizers, drum machine and music loops, as well as a large sound bank. The sounds are divided into various categories related to specific musical genres, which means that any person who deals with recording music can make use of the described tool. It is worth adding that you can also import sounds to the application base in MP3, WMA and AAC formats.
 
 Reason is characterized by a very complicated user interface that evidently suggests that we are dealing with a program addressed to experienced recipients. In the case of such people, it may initially be that the option screen is unreadable, but a dozen or so dozens of minutes will be enough to convince you that the GUI has been ingeniously designed and using it will not cause any problems for creators.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
