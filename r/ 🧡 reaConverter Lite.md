The reaConverter program in the free version, or Lite, allows you to convert images between five formats: BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF. It uses the same multithreaded engine for processing as paid releases, which gives it impressive performance. Besides, it contains all the possibilities of modification from the full version, so you can change the size, rotate it to any angle or add watermarks in the selected location.
 
 Further operations allow you to delete JPEG compression artefacts, anti-aliasing, denoising and coarse lens geometry correction. It's a good idea to do these tasks before applying effects, cropping a photo or adding frames. There were plenty of possibilities to adjust brightness, color saturation, sharpen and apply various filters to the pictures. Modify queues can be saved for reuse, just like file lists. 
 
 Attention!
 
 After installing the program, we can use a program limited to five files for one operation. Free registration allows you to take full advantage of the Lite version (5 file formats and all processing options).
 
 
 If its capabilities prove to be too small, you can buy licenses for more extended versions. The differences are described on the manufacturer's website .
