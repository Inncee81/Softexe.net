> Rocket Riot is a simple and addictive platformer, which is available on Windows 10. We are dealing with a universal application that will work on the desktop as well as the mobile Ten. The game pulls in and is a great proposition for devices with the latest Microsoft system, whose official store with applications looks very modestly.

The title is based on the older version released on Windows 8 and is available not only on the PC, but also mobile devices working under the control of Windows 10. Therefore, we got several methods to control the main character. We can fly and shoot using a touch screen or mouse and keyboard, as well as support for the Xbox controller.
 
 Production is about providing fun. We have over 200 missions available, which are available in nine campaigns. The goals themselves are quite absurd, but they cause a smile on your face. For example, we must help the pirate escape from prison so that he can then take revenge by stealing people's legs.
 
 This simple title can draw in and provide simple entertainment for a few hours. You must pay for access to the full version.
