> XML Viewer is a lightweight and free program that allows you to view the contents of XML files. It does not require installation, only unpacking from the ZIP archive, and thus does not leave unnecessary traces in the system registry and can easily be moved between computers.

The program is characterized by a simple but legible interface, which has been divided into several parts. The left panel shows the tree of the currently open XML document with specific field values, the right panel contains more detailed attributes and values. At the very bottom, there is general information about the file, such as size, the total number of tags in the document, or the time of parsing.
 
 Also below, below the general information panel, the user can switch between several views: document tree (Tree), preview (Preview) and content (Content). The program supports opening many documents in the form of bookmarks and does not contain many advanced options, simply offering a robust preview of XML files without unnecessary spammers.
