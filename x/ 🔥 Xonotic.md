Xonotic is a completely free, networked FPS that is the direct successor of Nexuiz, a project taken basically entirely by the community interested in the further development of the game. The title goes back to the times of Quake 1, which is evidenced by the fact that Xonotic operates on a heavily modified and modernized version of the engine of this game.

His network, peculiar character of the game and the entire game mechanics is very similar to Unreal Tournament, Cube, OpenAren or the already mentioned Quake. Originally, Xonotic was to be a continuation of the Nexuiz project but over time and along with the progress of work on the game, it acquired independence and many individual features, and this made it recognized as a completely separate and autonomous position in the entire genre set.
 
 The basic feature of the game is the dynamics, activity and liveliness of the game. In addition, the image of the game is always smooth regardless of the energetic and action effectiveness of the action. Given the fast pace of gameplay, stalking, wondering and planning in Xonotic simply does not take place. As soon as we appear on the battlefield without thinking, we engage in a duel.
 
 Online game modes such as Arena, Deathmatch or Capture The Flag are no surprise, because they are well known, for example, from many other titles belonging to the FPS influenza. Xonotic, however, offers something more in the form of such modes as, for example, Assault, Domination, Freeze Tag, Keepaway, Key Hunt, Nexball, Race or Runematch. It is also worth mentioning the availability of the singleplayer mode, which is great for preparing and making for online matches.
 
 The advanced scenery, richness of game modes, rich, futuristic weapons, incredible dynamics and unpredictability of the action will certainly not let anyone get bored with this title.
 
 
 Attention:
 
 On the project website are also available versions of the game for Linux and MacOS.
