> Xopero Cloud Personal is a program for creating and managing backups. It allows you to archive individual files, but also entire directories, an e-mail address and create disk images, including the operating system in all data, settings and programs. Created backups are stored on servers, and thus available at any time from anywhere in the world.

Application support is simple thanks to a clear interface that is not overloaded with unnecessary options. You can switch between main functions using the menu on the left. Apart from the summary page and shortcuts, the four main sections in the program are managing backup projects, restoring data, creating file folders awaiting synchronization and viewing the recent events log.
 
 During everyday use of the program, backups are automatically performed in the background, which means that they do not require a lot of input from the user to supervise them.
 
 All data that the program prepares for storing is encrypted with the AES 256 algorithm and physically stored in Polish server rooms. What's more, the backups are mirrored and saved in two locations so that they can be accessed by users in the event of a disaster.
