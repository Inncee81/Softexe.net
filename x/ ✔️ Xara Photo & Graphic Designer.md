The program copes well with RAW files from many cameras. Editing tools include cropping, color matching, masking sharpening, removing lens distortions, and basic retouching tools. You can remove unwanted objects from photos, improve the appearance of the skin, remove imperfections and wrinkles. You can also modify shapes by smooth forming.
 
 Design options are great for photomontages that can be composed on layers with different blend and merge modes. In addition, the program can be composed of panoramas and arbitrarily combine photo elements with illustrations, textures and vector graphics.
 
 
 Designing vector illustrations is very easy, thanks to Smart Shapes, whose shape can be freely modified with the help of special handles. In addition, the program allows you to design with the illusion of space, thanks to the settings of perspective, depth and angle of incidence of light. Vector graphics can also be "liquefied" with the help of special brushes. The user can of course create his own brushes based on fragments of photos and vector shapes.
