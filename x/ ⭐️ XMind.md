Thanks to the various functionalities offered by Xmind, we can prepare exactly the map of thoughts that we need, introducing new issues and creating connections between them. The key information in our document can also be distinguished by the appropriate color. In addition, all types of templates, graphic themes, clipart, shapes and tags are available. The authors also allow you to add short notes that allow you to describe the subject in detail.
 
 XMind allows you to filter markup for large mind maps, allowing you to "blank out" the currently unnecessary fragments of the mind map to focus the viewer's attention on currently important issues. The tool offers an advanced search engine that turns out to be extremely useful when our document contains a lot of different data.
 
 It is worth adding that XMind also takes care of the user's safety. You can secure your document with a password to prevent unauthorized access.
 
 XMind is available in three versions: free, Plus and Pro. In the free edition, we get the ability to create all kinds of mind maps, access to all topics, fonts and toolkits, and the option to save mind maps to Evernote and share them online. The Plus version enables exporting to PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OpenOffice and SVG, and also provides a package of extensive tools. The Pro edition also provides a presentation and brainstorming mode, a Gantt diagram and exporting to the Microsoft Project.
