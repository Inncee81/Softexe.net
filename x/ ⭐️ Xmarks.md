The extension can be installed in programs such as Safari, Firefox and Google Chrome. Thanks to Xmarks, we can use the same tabs on different computers, as well as back up your favorite websites. The latter will be useful if you lose data on your computer. What's more, the add-on remembers automatically the passwords and logins that we use when logging in to e-mail, on internet forums or blogs. Materials can be stored both in the cloud computing and on the server provided by the user (also private). All transmitted data is automatically encrypted.
 
 After installing Xmarks, a special assistant will be launched, which will guide you through the process of registering a free account, as well as selecting the elements that you want to synchronize or archive. You can also choose the main password that will protect access to Xmarks and stored materials. Other features of the add-in include advanced search, browsing information about pages, and tagging them. Xmarks is available in the Polish language version.
