```sh
XePlayer is an Android emulator, thanks to which we will launch various applications using this operating system on a computer with Windows installed.
```

However, this is not all, of course, because XePlayer also has many other useful features, reserved so far only for smartphones and tablets working under the control of Android. Noteworthy is also the fact that XePlayer has exactly the same user interface that can be found on these portable devices, so after switching on the described tool we will see a well-known icon distribution on the screen.
 
 XePlayer allows you to work in a window or full screen (the latter option is ideal for playing games downloaded from the Google Play store). The developers have also foreseen the option of modifying the keyboard control system (including the macro recording function), so that we can adapt it to your preferences. When using the mouse, move the cursor as if you were moving your finger on the touch screen of your smartphone or tablet.
 
 XePlayer requires you to log in to your Google account. If we do not have one, we can set it up for free.
