> XtremeMark is a tool used to test the performance of a computer with particular emphasis on the CPU unit by performing a large number of parallel computations and more. This is a good proposition for those who would like to check, even out of curiosity, the performance of their PC.

The application will easily check the operation of both newer and older processors on 32 and 64-bit operating systems. XtremeMark supports multi-core and multi-threaded CPUs (up to 16 cores or parallel threads). One of the main advantages of this program is the multitude of options: the user can choose the number of threads to test, and also decide how many calculations to be made as part of the processor performance check (from 10 million to 100 billion).
 
 After testing, XtremeMark generates a short report with detailed information about the result. It can be exported to a separate file saved in TXT or RTF format, to be available later on the Internet (eg send by e-mail or put on a discussion board) or print.
