> X-Bomber is a free space shooter in the old style, following in the footsteps of such hits as the unforgettable Raptor or Tyrian. The inspiration for the creation of this free proposal was a Japanese fairy tale with puppets, telling about the last hope of humanity in the fight against a powerful enemy, the title unit with enormous firepower. You do not need to know the events from the series. The gameplay boils down to eliminating more enemies.

We fly steadily, spreading the enemy units to dust. Always keep in mind the level of shields, armor and weapon energy. Ships have several attack modes, useful in different situations. For example, lasers work best on large but slow objects, and fast enemies will more effectively destroy weak but homogenous beams. We get a variety of missions to perform.
 
 
 The game offers very good quality, detailed graphics, as well as catchy sound. The eye has many visual effects. There is, of course, a system of collecting offensive and defensive afterburner drugs on the way. Sometimes there are too many on the screen, but this is only to keep the player alert. For years, X-Bomber managed to gather around him a large community of loyal fans.
