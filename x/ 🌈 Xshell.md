```sh
Xshell is a client of SSH protocols (also with X11 relay support), Telnet, Rlogin and serial transmission. The program is based on the popular PuTTY code, but has a much more extensive interface and richer configuration.

In addition to being able to connect to other machines, Xshell also has a local console that is very similar to the Windows command line, but it can be opened as a tab in the program window and used for color schemes. The terminal fully supports UTF8, thanks to which it is possible to work in many languages. With SSH connections it is possible to set up encrypted tunnels and port forwarding, which can be conveniently monitored from the Xshella level. An interesting addition is Compose Bar - a bar that allows you to enter commands locally and then send them to one or more open sessions in a given window. Frequently used commands or shell scripts can be saved and placed on the button bar. Of course, the content of this bar can be customized to suit your needs. 
 
 
 As befits a full SSH client, Xshell supports authorization using RSA and DSA keys, which can also generate, import and export. In addition, it supports the encryption of AES128 / 192/256, 3DES, BLOWFISH, CAST128, ARCFOUR and RIJNDAEL using the SHA1, SHA1-96, MD5, MD5-96 and RIPEMD160 MAC algorithms. 
 
 
 Attention!
 
 The Xshell program is available for free to home users and students. A 30-day trial version is available for companies. To use the free version of the program, select the appropriate option during installation.
 
 If Xshell is accompanied by the Xftp program, it is very easy to make FTP / SFTP connections from the same window in which the terminals are open.
