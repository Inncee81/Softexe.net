```sh
Xpadder is an application that allows you to manage programs in the Windows operating system using a gamepad replacing the mouse and keyboard in this role. In addition to it, you can connect an arcade stick or joystick to your computer. She also cooperates with dance mats, steering wheels, percussion sets and guitars.

The gamepad connected and configured in the Xpadder program will be used, for example, to browse the resources of websites, to handle multimedia applications (movies or music files) and to perform many other activities. 
 
 Interestingly, Xpadder allows you to connect up to sixteen controllers at the same time - this option is useful when playing computer games in multiplayer, but not only. Thanks to the described program, the gamepad will work even in games whose creators did not anticipate the support of another controller than the mouse and keyboard.
 
 Attention!
 
 We provide the last, free version of Xpadder. The application is still developed by the producer, but its subsequent versions are payable.
