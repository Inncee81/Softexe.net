The application offers a set of ready-made profiles containing settings of individual parameters, necessary when converting to a different format. The program also allows you to convert data stored on unprotected DVDs and Blu-ray discs, and automatically converts the bitrate to the current loaded media file (using the built-in bit calculator).
 
 
 After loading any files to XMedia Recode, we get their full name, duration, current codec and audio parameters (sound quality, format and frequency). XMedia Recode offers the option of adjusting the appropriate resolution, video codec, setting the output stream, and includes functions to normalize the sound volume and determine the order of the audio channels being played. 
 
 
 The program also included a built-in player for viewing modified multimedia files and additional tools and filters, with which we will improve the sharpness and color of the image, as well as define the aspect ratio and the resolution of the video material. XMedia Recorde also allows you to supplement the label of audio and video files, in which you can enter the title of the song / movie, year of production, name of the producer and put your own commentary and choose one of the available categories.
 
 
 The software supports the following audio and video file formats: 3GP, 3GPP, 3GPP2, AAC, AC3, AMR, ASF, AVI, AVISynth, DVD, FLAC, FLV, H.261, H.263, H.264, M4A, M1V, M2V , M4V, Matroska (MKV), MMF, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, TS, TRP, MP2, MP3, MP4, MP4V, MOV, QT, OGG, PSP, RM, (S) VCD, SWF , VOB, WAV, WebM, WMA and WMV.
