XMeters is a program that works mainly in the form of a task bar visible next to the Windows system tray, which displays useful statistics related to the processor, hard drive work, network connection and memory usage.

After starting, the user can decide whether the information collected by XMeters should be displayed on the taskbar or in the main program window. Generally, however, the tool was created to perform this first function. In this way, we do not have to switch among other applications, because we have all the data at your fingertips.
  
 XMeters is fully customizable, thanks to which we can define what values ​​and in what form they are to be presented on the taskbar (bars, pie charts or text information in any color from the entire color palette). It is also possible to set the information refresh rate.
