X-VPN is a small application that is aimed at users who value privacy and security during everyday use of the Internet.

From the main window of the described tool, we can connect to the recommended server with just one click or select it from the list. In this way, we hide our real IP address (we will be visible as if we were in the US or any other country), which will make it impossible to detect our activity.
 
 X-VPN, just like other programs of this type, unblocks access to blocked content in the user's country, for example due to the applicable copyright. Thanks to this we will be able to browse the entire content of YouTube and Netflix websites as well as films made available on various network websites.
 
 It is worth mentioning that X-VPN uses 256-bit encryption and can be useful in situations where we use public Wi-Fi networks through which we log in to the bank account.
