```sh
XenCenter is a free, integrated administration console that allows you to configure, manage, monitor and update XenServer servers.
```
[![XenCenter](https://gallery.dpcdn.pl/imgc/Tools/1680/g_-_420x350_1.5_-_x20110116230749_00.png)](https://softexe.net/win/development-it/development-tools/xencenter:pbcRf.html)

XenCenter provides options to create and manage server pools as well as a single host. Using the console, you can easily add and edit virtual machines, virtual disks and local and shared data stores, as well as manage virtual networks. In each virtual machine, a graphic KVM is available, which - if possible - can work using Remote Desktop. XenCenter also allows you to assign licenses to hosts and generate reports on the status of the pool or individual servers. It is also the only tool that allows you to install patches for the hypervisor.
 
 You can extend XenCenter capabilities by installing unofficial community-created extensions, such as creating a connection map or managing an external license server directly in the program.
