It allows not only managing files and multimedia on the device from a computer, but also accessing applications made available by the manufacturer or operator, updating the telephone software and online user support, technical support and various types of instructions. The program significantly improves the search, as well as installing software on the device, which was issued by the manufacturer and the mobile network operator.
 
 The Xperia Companion support is very simple. The package has a clear graphical interface and is available in many language versions - including Polish. The whole has been divided into several modules responsible for performing specific tasks and operations. The connection with the phone can be done via a USB cable, Bluetooth interface or WiFi network. However, the manufacturer recommends using the first of these methods to connect the device to the computer. In addition, an Internet connection is required to download applications and updates.
