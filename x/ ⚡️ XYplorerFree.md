The tool provides the Windows user with comfortable and comfortable management of files stored on computer disks as well as those from optical media. Similarly to the paid version, XYplorerFree is characterized by a large number of configuration options that allow you to easily adjust individual aspects of the work (such as the presentation of data) to individual (even excessive) user preferences. There were also functions that allow you to efficiently change file names from the program level and create compressed ZIP archives from them.
 
 The XYplorerFree address bar, unlike its system counterpart, can also handle file names, search commands and URLs besides the exact path. The great advantage of the application is a large number of available filters and statistics, allowing efficient management and analyzing data collected on a data carrier. The advantage of the tool is also an extensive history function, allowing you to view the list, among others all locations that we viewed in any panel.
 
 Attention!
