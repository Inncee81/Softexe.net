In the case of V2V conversion, the tool allows you to migrate whole VMware virtual machines working with Windows or Linux exported in OVF format or individual disks stored in VMDK files. The source material can also be disks recorded in VHD format and XenServer - XVA templates. The conversion can also include the system installed on a physical machine (P2V). 
 
 As a result of conversion, XenConvert creates a virtual machine directly on the selected XenServer host or as VHD files. Everything is done using a convenient wizard in graphical mode. An article on using the XenConvert tool can be found on the TechIT website .Attention!
 
 
 Windows XP is only supported in the Professional version, and Windows Vista only in the Business, Enterprise and Ultimate versions. For Windows 7, all versions are supported.
