With the help of 3uTools, we will be able to add and delete files, download new applications from the digital store, add wallpapers to the desktop and download ringtones. This is not the end, as it is also possible to clean the system from unnecessary files, convert video and audio, manage media, transfer photos, delete unneeded icons, back up data and restore previous settings.
 
 3uTools also allows you to jailbreak the device (with just one click!), And thus allows you to bypass security that prevents the installation of some programs.
