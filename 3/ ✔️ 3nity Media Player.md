Among the files that we can play with the help of 3nity Media Player can be mentioned for example AVI, MKV, DivX, MP4, OGG, ACC and more. The program will also easily handle the playback of Internet streams (for example, Internet radio or podcasts), reading a movie on a DVD or an audio CD. It also has options to use it as a "player" for TV cards. All this takes place as part of a light interfes whose individual elements can be activated and as needed.
 
 Playable media can not only be viewed in a window or full screen, but also slightly improved thanks to the built-in functions such as sharpening the image, improving brightness, color saturation, or using the equalizer to adjust the sound. 3nity Media Player will also handle video files with multiple audio tracks, having menus (as in the case of DVD movies) or subtitles.
