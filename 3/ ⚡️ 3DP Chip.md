After launching 3DP Chip, we will be able to read detailed information about the components of our computer (processor, RAM, motherboard, graphics card, multimedia devices, network card and others). By clicking on the icon of one of them we will check if we have the latest version of the driver. If not, 3D Chip will offer the option to download the appropriate files.
 
 3DP Chip allows you to create a backup copy and restore installed drivers. It is worth using this functionality so that you do not have to download various drivers after reinstalling the Windows operating system.
