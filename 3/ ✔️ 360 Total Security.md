360 Total Security is a powerful antivirus solution that can not only protect your computer from all sorts of threats and unwanted programs, but also provides additional opportunities for optimizing and cleaning your PC for more stable and fast work.

The operation of this application is based on five engines, four of which are responsible, strictly speaking, for proactive protection and security (Avira, Bitdefender, QVM II and 360 Cloud Cloud), and the fifth (System Repair) allows you to restore the system. This combination provides both high-quality protection and preserves PC performance. Whatever the user is doing on the Internet, and whatever resources he visits, this antivirus will act as an impregnable guardian who protects the system online. There are several types of computer scan for malware - quick scan, full scan and selective scan of the desired item.

As already noted, 360 Total Security is equipped with a system optimization function that will help to set up automatic launch of applications, components and plug-ins, significantly improving the speed of both loading and general work. In addition, by clearing unnecessary and unused traces of installed applications, you can free up some of the space on the hard drive, because there is not much free space. Another useful option is to analyze the installed operating system for official updates and security fixes, after which 360 Total Security will immediately offer to install such fixes. 
Well, it is impossible not to note the specially designed sandbox Sandbox, in which you can work with suspicious files and programs, without worrying about the possible undesirable consequences.

All this is designed in a great graphical interface, where each function is highlighted in a separate tab for quick and easy access to it. The interface itself is intuitive and easy to learn for inexperienced users, even without Russian localization.

This antivirus will be a good helper for all users, providing comprehensive proactive PC protection with the detection of the latest threats, and allowing, if necessary, to optimize the system to speed up and improve stability.
