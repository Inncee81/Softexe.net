Model building can be accelerated thanks to the extensive features of "Object Building Tools". The program is equipped with the necessary tools to create animations (scene planning, support to help you get smooth motion effects). The 3D Crafter capabilities can be extended with plug-ins (plugins), the number of which is impressive on the market (if there is a lot of interest in the program or we get information from users about such demand, we will build the appropriate database of plugins and make it available on the portal).Attention ! 
 MS Windows Installer version 2.0 is required to install the program. If you do not have such versions, you can download it in the PROGRAMS section -&gt; Extras -&gt; Updates
