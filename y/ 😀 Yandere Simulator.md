Yandere Simulator is a third-person stealth game with graphic design that will satisfy anime lovers. In terms of game mechanics, the game can be compared to the cult series Hitman allowing you to play the role of a killer on the job.

During the game, we direct the title Yandere, which is a girl in love with a boy from the same school. A jealous teenager decides to get rid of anyone who, even for a moment, shows interest in her chosen heart, while not arousing suspicion among her peers and teachers.
 
 Yandere Simulator is inspired by the already mentioned adventures of Agent 47. The same as in IO Interactive games we get a large map, where we find many independent characters, and our task is to locate and eliminate a person in one of many possible ways (eg silently or by arranging an accident). In addition, you must remember to remove traces of crime in such a way that the police could not link Yandere to the given murder.
 
 Before launching the Yandere Simulator you should know that the game has not been completed yet. The authors intend to improve character animations as well as the quality of graphic design. The final release of the described production will be able to boast of more functions. Although the game does not contain pornographic content, the creators inform that it is intended only for adult audiences.
