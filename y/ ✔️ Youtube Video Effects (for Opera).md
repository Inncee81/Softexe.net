The program is compatible with Google Chrome, Opera and Firefox. After installing the YouTube Video Effects plugin, we can apply just over 50 effects in just two clicks to change the climate of the video material. There are, among others, filters such as love, heat, moonlight, sepia, gray, drawing, blur, contour and edge map.
 
 YouTube Video Effects also includes night mode so we can watch your favorite YouTube videos with a dark theme. Comfortable use also ensures the function of adjusting the size of the film to the size of the window. Noteworthy is the option of removing black bars in video materials.
 
 It is worth noting that YouTube Video Effects also allows you to automatically change the quality of movies, so we can play them even in resolutions of 8K, QUHD, 4320p, but nothing prevents you from checking how the material looks in 144p quality.
