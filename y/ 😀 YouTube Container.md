> YouTube Container is an add-on to Firefox that isolates all user activity associated with YouTube on the container. The add-on is based on the official Facebook Container extension, the possibilities of which are analogous, but in relation to Facebook, Messenger and Instagram.

Here, in an isolated container, all the activities related to YouTub are launched. The user does not have to do anything to do this. Visiting the site results in an automatic launch in a container, beyond which the activity on the portal will not be visible.
 
 As in the case of the original, also here we have practically no settings available (there are only those regarding the update), and the operation of the add-on we learn from the address bar - on the right side there is a red padlock icon and the YouTube sign .
