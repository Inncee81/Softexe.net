> YTD Video Downloader (once YouTube Downloader) is one of the most popular tools for downloading short video clips from the Internet.

Working with the program is very simple and is limited to pasting in the main window of the link to the selected clip. In addition, the user has the ability to define the quality of the downloaded video and the location where it will be saved. By default, YTD Video Downloader saves clips as FLV files, however, once the download process is complete, it offers the ability to convert to MOV, MP4, 3GP, WMV, AVI or MP3 formats compatible with iPod, iPhone, PSP, portable media players and smartphones. There are also functions that allow you to change the sound volume, as well as to cut clips from the clips. The tool has been equipped with a built-in player, giving the ability to view saved FLV files, without the need for additional software.
 
 The free version, despite its considerable functionality, has some limitations compared to the paid edition (Pro). They introduce, among others the limit of simultaneously downloaded videos, lower the speed of recording, and also do not provide the ability to convert clips automatically after downloading.Attention!
 
 The installation wizard offers the user to install additional components. They are not required to run the program and we advise you not to install these components, while recommending that you carefully read the information displayed by the wizard, which will avoid introducing any additional changes to the system.
