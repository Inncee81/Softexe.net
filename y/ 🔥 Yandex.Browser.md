Yandex.Browser is an easy to use web browser, offering a lot of useful options for both less and more demanding users.

The browser has an uncomplicated, minimalistic interface, thanks to which the vast majority of the screen is occupied by the web page that we browse. The program includes a Turbo function that compresses data to improve the speed of the site. Thanks to the SmartBox function, you can enter the search criteria in a special window, and the hint system will allow you to find the necessary content faster and correct any spelling mistakes.
 
 Yandex.Browser automatically imports settings (bookmarks, browsing history and others) from the previous browser. We do not have to worry about viruses - websites are checked by the Yandex security system, and each downloaded file is scanned using Kaspersky Anti-Virus.
 
 The application allows the translation of foreign websites and supports nine languages, such as English, German, French, Polish, Ukrainian, Italian, Spanish, Turkish and Russian. An interesting addition is also colorful widgets presenting current information, including weather or traffic jams.
