> Yaf (a) Ray (Yet Another Free Raytracer) is an extensive raytracer supported from the command line. It is dedicated to cooperation with raytracer-free modeling programs, such as Blender (which for a long time uses it by default to render the image) or Wings 3D.

Yaf (a) Ray is a multiplatform application that, based on a previously prepared scene description, creates its visual representation (ray tracing rendering). Yaf (a) Ray is an open-plan project with a modular structure, which currently supports a number of advanced algorithms supporting the tracking of rays (spatial lighting, sky-lighting, HDRI, caustics, image depth and subtle blurring effects behind matte glass).Thanks to the open code and the complete API (specification of external program communication with the YafRay core), Yaf (a) Ray has been integrated with such applications as Blender, Wings 3D and MakeHuman.
