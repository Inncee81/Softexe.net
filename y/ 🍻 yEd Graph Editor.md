The program is perfect for representing various IT processes, but it will also work well in many other applications. It supports diagrams of various types, ranging from those that improve the work of programmers and illustrate the operation of algorithms, whether the flow of data in the application, as well as those helpful in the design of local networks in the home or business. The tool can be used successfully for the user to create mind maps, family trees, sequence diagrams and many, many others.
 
 yEd Graph Editor allows you to create simple diagrams, as well as very complex UML, BPMN or semantic networks. The user's user has a huge palette of possible objects and various types of connections. The user can freely manipulate many attributes of each component, import data from Excel sheets or XML file, and the program will make sure that no clutter appears in our diagrams (automatic improvement of intersecting connections, etc.).
 
 Using the tool, we will prepare diagrams which will then be exported to PNG, JPG, SVG, PDF and SWF files.
