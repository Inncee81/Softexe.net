From the official website of the manufacturer, we can activate this plug-in with two mouse clicks. Its icon will appear in the upper right corner of the browser interface. YouTube Video and Audio Downloader offers the YouTube launch feature without the need to enter the site address (just use the appropriate button).
 
 After opening the page with the material you want to download, click the YouTube Video and Audio Downloader icon in the browser again, then select the "Quick Download" option, which will download the file in a specific format (eg MP3). However, it is worth using the "Download Panel" function, where you can choose whether the downloaded material should contain only the sound or the image (in the second case, we will specify both the format and the resolution of the file).
 
 YouTube Video and Audio Downloader is a completely free tool that does not require any special knowledge on the part of the user, and also to a negligible extent consumes computer resources, so it will also work successfully on older devices.
