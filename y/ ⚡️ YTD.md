The program is one of many representatives of "downloaders" and it looks nice to pay for a paid offer. The interface is clear, but at the same time colorful and simply visually attractive. The service itself comes down to entering the URL to the desired video to the clipboard and selecting the appropriate option in the application - we can also simply "drag" the link to the material on a special icon that appears on top of other open applications.
 
 In the options you can choose the preferred resolution (up to FullHD, or 1080p) and a list of supported formats, among which we can find in principle all the most important and most popular audio and video formats. In addition, we can convert downloaded materials into another, selected format. YTD also allows you to download multiple clips at once, it has pauses and resumes downloading and previewing material during the operation itself.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 10 days.
