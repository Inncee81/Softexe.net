This tool turns out to be a great proposition for users who watch a lot of videos on YouTube and do not want to waste time changing the player window size, disabling annotations or changing the quality of a given material to 4K (2160p), 1440p, 1080p, 720p, 480p , 360p, 240p or 144p. 
 
 Thanks to YouTube High Definition, you can not only set the site to automatically display content in a window of the indicated size, but also in High Definition. In addition, this add-on allows you to disable automatic movie playback and even mute the sound after it has been started (this option is useful especially at night when you do not want to wake up the house after turning on the loud video).
 
 YouTube High Definition is also addressed to music fans who listen to their favorite songs through this site. Automatically increases the sound quality in all songs available on YouTube.
