Unlike many other applications of this type, YouTube Downloader X automatically extracts the soundtrack (it is not possible to download all video material) and saves it in a previously defined format by the user (MP3, FLAV, WAV, VORBIS). Before you start using YTDX, you must also specify the target track for saving the downloaded song.
 
 YTDX (YouTube Downloader X) has been designed so as not to cause any problems to anyone. When using YouTube, just copy the address with your favorite piece to the clipboard, then paste it in the main program window and press the "download" button.
 
 When the download is complete, YTDX displays a notification and allows you to immediately open the folder in which the downloaded file will be available.
