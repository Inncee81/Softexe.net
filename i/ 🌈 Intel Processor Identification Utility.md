```sh
An Intel tool that identifies the processor installed on the computer. The program supports only Intel processors. Intel Processor Identification Utility provides information on two processor and bus frequencies - such as was recognized during production tests as the maximum for this particular unit and the current processor. In addition, information is available on the exact type of processor, the amount of cache L1 and L2 cache, connector, architecture, the number of cores with support (or not) technology: Intel Virtualization Technology, Hyper-Threading, Intel Extended Memory 64, Enhanced Intel SpeedStep, etc.
