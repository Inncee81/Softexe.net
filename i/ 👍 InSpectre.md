> InSpectre is a simple tool to check the vulnerability of Windows systems to the famous attacks Meltdown and Specter.

[![InSpectre](https://gallery.dpcdn.pl/imgc/Tools/80088/g_-_420x350_1.5_-_x828bd250-dc4c-47ea-af29-168ad3e257c4.png)](https://softexe.net/win/security-privacy/other/inspectre:pRcad.html)

The tool does not need installation or internet access. Once launched, it evaluates the security status at the microcode level of the processor and the operating system itself. It also shows the estimated impact of patches on Meltdown and Specter on computer performance.
 
 If the computer with active patches is unstable, or if their overhead is too large, we can disable the selected patches by clicking Disable Meltdown Protection / Disable Specter Protection.
 
 Of course, we can also re-enable the same patches. After each state change, it is necessary to restart the system.
