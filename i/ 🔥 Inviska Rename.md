The program allows you to enter, delete and modify text in the file name and extension. It is possible to change the name using the information contained in the music tags (supported tags are primarily mp3 ID3v2 and FLAC). However, this is not the end, because the program is also addressed to photographers and allows you to change the name based on Exif information contained in digital photographs.
 
 Inviska Rename will also rename files based on other criteria, such as the date of creation or modification of selected files. In addition, the tool can be used to automatically number your documents, allowing you to rename files so that they all start with a small or capital letter.
 
 In order to facilitate the use of Inviska Rename, the developers provided the option of filtering files, and also allowed to display hidden data, which we can add or exclude when performing file rename operations in batch mode. In addition, if you make a mistake, you'll be able to undo the last steps to restore the original names of documents, graphics, or any other data.
 
 Full Unicode support makes Inviska Rename rename files in every language. Individuals who will often use the described application using the same settings can easily save them so that they do not have to configure new guidelines related to the rename operation every time.
