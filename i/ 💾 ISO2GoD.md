ISO2GoD is a tool for converting ISO images with games on Xbox 360 or Xbox One to Games of Demand (GoD) format, which will make them work faster on converted Xbox 360 consoles (Jtag, RGH).

However, greater efficiency is not all that can be obtained after using ISO2GoD. After changing the file extension and starting the game, we will shorten the loading time of your favorite titles. In addition, you can also count on less noise in the room, because some models of consoles (especially the older ones) generate annoying sounds when firing titles through the DVD drive.
 
 ISO2GoD allows you to specify the output path and destination of the recording (it can be HDD or FTP). Sometimes we need to indicate an additional location, where only temporary files necessary for the application after the conversion could connect all created fragments of the given files. We will do this without problems on individual ISO images, but nothing prevents ISO2GoD from working in batch mode.
 
 It is worth noting that ISO2GoD is an easy-to-use program with an intuitive user interface, thanks to which less experienced recipients will also be able to handle it.
