The program, compared to its predecessor, is characterized by much greater detection and efficiency in the fight against malware, distributed mainly via the Internet. It has been equipped with an improved, dual-core scanning engine and a heuristic protection mechanism, which protects the computer against new, yet unknown threats. In the case of the latter, IObit Malware Fighter offers a new heuristic algorithm called DOG (Digital Original Gene), evaluating the main attributes related to software development, its distribution and advertising.
 
 IObit Malware Fighter Free allows you to scan your computer's content in up to 3 modes: Fast (the most important parts of the system), Full (all space of all hard drives in the computer) and User (only locations indicated by the user). The program also gives the opportunity to carry out autoscanate at the scheduled time or when the system is idle.
 
 The built-in real-time protection module includes elements such as system start, browser, network, files and so-called. cookies. The paid version Pro additionally protects active processes, used USB drives and detects threats by analyzing malicious activities. A novelty in relation to the predecessor is the ability to examine suspicious files in the cloud, on the external servers of the manufacturer.Attention!
 The installation wizard suggests installing additional components, which we do not recommend. Deselecting the appropriate options avoids the installation of additional components and software in the system.
 
 By default, the program is run in the English language version. The option to change the interface to Polish can be found in the tool settings in the 'User Interface' tab.
