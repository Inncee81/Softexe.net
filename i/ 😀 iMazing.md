The program allows you to use these devices as from external data storage. When connected to a computer, Windows detects them as standard hard drives and allows you to easily transfer files and folders between your computer and the iPhone. In addition, iMazing supports the "drag-and-drop" method which further improves the comfort of working with the application.
 
 In addition to the aforementioned functions, iMazing gives the user the ability to manage such device contents as SMS messages, contact list or calendars, notes, call history, voice messages and even program data. The application offers an extensive mechanism for creating and restoring backups, which can take into account only the elements chosen by us. Data backup can be done securely via wireless networks.
 
 iMazing allows you to connect your Apple device in the standard way via a USB cable and wirelessly over WiFi. For proper operation of the tool, installation on the iTunes computer is not required.
