Icon Explorer is a small and free tool for viewing and managing icons in Windows. The program is characterized by a simple, thought-out interface and support for all major formats.

The program window is divided into several sections, from which you should indicate a directory with an EXE or DLL file from which you want to view or extract icons. The program will check the available icon packages in a second, allowing you to select the desired graphics along with all available sizes (the application supports sizes of icons from 16x16 to 256x256). The selected icon can then be saved in BMP or ICO format with the right mouse button.
 
 In addition, Icon Explorer has a built-in search engine, through which we can search the contents of the hard disk for icons. The program is really nice to use, all elements are set so that they give easy and quick access to specific icons or their packages.
