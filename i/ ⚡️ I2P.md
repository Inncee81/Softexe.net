> I2P (Invisible Internet Project) is a network that allows for encrypted communication, thus ensuring greater privacy and anonymity for the user browsing the Internet. A distributed structure is used here, thanks to which all external attacks are more difficult, and the risk of failure of the whole system is much lower.

The solution is characterized by a whole lot of configuration built-in. After installation, we get access to the virtual router, and in its settings we can control the details of the traffic. Configuration takes place from the browser level, but instead of remembering the appropriate alias, just use the appropriate icon after installation (there are several).
 
 If you are not interested in additional options, the program remains very easy to use. All you have to do is start a network connection service (Windows Firewall will probably ask you to accept access) and then wait for it to be established. The icon on the taskbar also informs you about the connection status.
