Performing a partition resizing operation is usually synonymous with the necessity of formatting and losing data, but using the IM-Magic Partition Resizer, we can perform the mentioned action, keeping all files (including those that support our operating system, of course). It is worth adding that the size of the partition can be determined manually by entering the appropriate size, and using the slider.
 
 IM-Magic Partition Resizer seems to be addressed to more advanced users, but in fact we are dealing with an extremely easy-to-use program that allows you to resize an existing partition with three mouse clicks. In the event of failure or mistake, it is possible to undo the last actions.
