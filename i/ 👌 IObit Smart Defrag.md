The algorithm responsible for defragmentation was designed in such a way that the time of data optimization on modern and large disks was as short as possible taking into account the fastest access to data. According to the information provided by the manufacturer, the application is ahead of products such as Defraggler, JKDefrag, Auslogics DiskDefrag, Diskeeper Pro or built-in tool in Windows.
 
 IObit Smart Defrag, apart from the statistics, is also characterized by the option of activating the automatic defragmentation of the system in the background (eg when the computer is at rest) and the function of optimizing the location of files. The authors also thought about the fact that IObit Smart Defrag offered the possibility of scheduling disk optimization, thanks to which the user can control the systematic care of the condition of the HDD. There was no option to defragment the boot area and optimize the disk for games.
