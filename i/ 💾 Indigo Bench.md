> Indigo Bench is a very easy to use free tool for testing the performance of the processor and graphics card. It uses advanced rendering technology, Indigo 4.

The application does not require any configuration. Just start it and then select the "start" option from the main window. The benchmark will begin, during which Indigo Bench will check the operation of the GPU and CPU in two stages (bedroom and super car).
 
 Among the supported chips, of course, we find the products of the most popular companies, namely NVIDIA, AMD and Intel, so you do not have to worry that the tool can not handle the graphics card or processor you have. 
 
 After completing the test in Indigo Bench, we can copy the results to the clipboard or share them via the official website of the application (the user's account is required).
