IronCAD is a professional CAD program for 2D and 3D parametric design. The program conveniently combines the possibility of direct modeling in a 3D environment with design based on the history of operations. IronCAD will work just as well when drawing and delivering models ready for production.

IronCAD offers relatively simple and very effective solutions in the field of project creation and re-use of delivered elements. One of its advantages is the ability to work with two graphic engines - ACIS (Dassault Systems) and Parasolid (Siemens). This allows for precise conversion of models from other 3D CAD systems and export to many formats, including native SAT and X_T as well as IGS, Catia and STEP. The combination of engines also allows you to generate models that you probably can not create using only one of the engines. Switching between motors is possible while working with the program.
 
 The program implements a catalog system that allows you to store any of your hockey, team, parts, operations or functions in a hierarchical structure. Catalogs can be shared with other team members, set permissions and search. Importantly, the elements imported from the catalogs have a proper orientation in space and can have limitations needed when designing moving structures. When designing this type, it is also possible to use the motion analysis of elements with regard to defined bonds, as well as the collision detection and highlighting of contact areas.
 
 
 The program also included a module for the design of pipelines and heat centers. All element libraries have snap points defined, thanks to which the structures fit together perfectly and automatically detect the diameters of the adjacent parts. In addition, the program pre-detects collisions. On the basis of the model, you can immediately prepare 2D documentation, automatically number the parts and generate a list of items needed for cost estimation.
 
 
 
 IronCAD also allows you to use two modules for designing frame structures. The first of these works similar to those found in Solidworks or Inventor - you should design a 3D path or a 2D sketch in it and place the appropriate profile. The second is to drag and drop items. The wizard has a built-in library of standardized profiles that are automatically matched. When modeling, you can also use direct editing, because the design process is not rigidly linked to the history of operations.
 
 
 IronCAD has, of course, been equipped with a system for calculating sheet metal development with dedicated operations of bending, embossing, hole drilling and the like. The program can automatically convert bends and mark lines. The project with this information can be saved immediately in DXF or DWG formations and sent for cutting. The finished project can also be visualized in three dimensions for marketing purposes. IronCAD can integrate with external renderers, for example with KeyShot . Thanks to this, iRonCAD has also been used in the field of spatial advertising when designing letters and signs.
