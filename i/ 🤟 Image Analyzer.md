Thanks to the simple interface and the Polish language version, the program is accessible to practically every user - although it should be noted that the program is not full. With any picture open, we can start working with a range of available tools that allow you to change the color balance, brightness and contrast levels, color saturation, anti-aliasing and more.
 
 The biggest changes are available from the Operations menu, which individual options have been sorted, and thus are easy to find. After selecting an interesting user option, we can easily see the expected effect on the preview, which avoids the unexpected results of a particular filter or tools. In addition, the number of program functions can be increased using plug-ins. Supported recording / reading formats: BMP, ICO, CUR, WMF, EMF, PNG, MNG, GIF, PCX, JPEG. In addition, the reading is possible for the formats CR2, RAS, PNM, PGM, PPM, HIPS and Matlab files.
