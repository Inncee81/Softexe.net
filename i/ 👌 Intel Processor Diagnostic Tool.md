The user can choose one of the three modes of the Intel Processor Diagnostic Tool before starting the test: quick (Quick Test), full (Full Functional Test) and the maximum load (Burn In Test), as well as specify various parameters, including the time of loading the system or also the temperature tolerance of the processor. 
 
 Intel Processor Diagnostic Tool checks various processor parameters, such as: operating temperature, base clock, cache memory, generation of prime and floating point numbers, MMX and SSE instructions, AVX extensions, voltage and enumeration of the PCH controller. In addition, the integrated Intel graphics card is also tested.
 
 If during the summary it turns out that the CPU is not working properly, a relative error message will appear on the screen. It is also worth adding that the report generated by the Intel Processor Diagnostic Tool can be saved as a text file.
