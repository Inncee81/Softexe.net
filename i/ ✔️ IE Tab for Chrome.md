Using the extension, we have the ability to browse websites that require ActiveX controls, display and use files saved on a computer disk (using Windows Explorer), use Outlook Web Access and Sharepoint platform functions, available only from Internet Explorer. IE Tab for Chrome will also appreciate the creators of websites, because it allows you to conveniently check the correctness of project display in the Microsoft browser without having to run it.
 
 The extension allows you to display pages in Chrome tabs using the rendering engines used in Internet Explorer 7, 8 and 9. Other features available in IE Tab for Chrome are the Auto URL to create a list of URLs that will be automatically launched using IE, as well as a list of pages excluded.
