i.Scribe is a Polish-language mail client with small size, high speed of operation and an intuitive interface. It does not require installation, so it can be successfully transferred, for example, to a floppy disk or a pendrive type (USB key). This allows you to receive and access the mail at any position with Internet access - which can be a big advantage for many users. 
 
 Icribe's "Mobility" is not the only advantage. It allows for for importing messages and contacts from other e-mail programs, offers address book, schedule calendar, anti-spam options, templates, filters, message slots and much more ... The program's capabilities can also be increased with additional plugins.
