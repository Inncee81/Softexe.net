As the program has been called iRingg, it is aimed mainly at iPhone owners. Nothing, however, prevents you to save your ringtones not in the memory of this Apple device, but on your computer's hard drive, and then copy them to your Android smartphone.
 
 Thanks to iRingg we can create a ringtone from any video or audio material made available via YouTube or SoundCloud. There is also an option to record your own messages in the form of humorous inserts.
 
 iRingg allows you to use the content of these websites for your own use, so that the user does not infringe on copyright.
