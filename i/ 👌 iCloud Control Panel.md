iCloud is a service that allows storing user data on Apple servers such as e-mail, calendar, contacts, tasks, documents, as well as music, photos and more. Importantly, all content placed in iCloud automatically and immediately (provided that certain requirements are met, such as, for example, wireless network connectivity) are transmitted by push to other devices - for example, an iPad, an iPhone or an iPod touch. In this way, even if photos taken with an iPhone within a few seconds are downloaded to the iPad.
 
 iCloud Control Panel is used to make these photos and other content stored in the cloud also downloaded to a computer. The application allows you to synchronize your e-mail, calendar, contacts and tasks with Outlook. We can also synchronize bookmarks with Internet Explorer or Safari browsers. It is also possible to synchronize photos in the Photo Stream service - in the application settings we select the folders to which the images are downloaded.
