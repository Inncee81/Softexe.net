Invoicera's capabilities do not differ significantly from other free programs of this type and include issuing invoices, maintaining a database of contractors and goods, printing price lists etc. What distinguishes it is the rare possibility of printing invoices in many languages ​​(except Polish also in English and German), which it is necessary for entities selling overseas. The program also allows for cooperation with fiscal printers (Posnet, Elzab) which is also rarely found among free invoicing programs.
 
 Pros of the Invoicera has a specific interface that makes the program requires a certain habit, as well as a general feeling of underdevelopment.
