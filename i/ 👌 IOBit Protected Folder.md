The program was created mainly for beginning users who would like to prevent access to private files to unauthorized persons. It does not require almost any configuration, it is enough to run the program, define the main password and proceed to secure the data. This is also very simple and is limited to loading files and folders in the main program window that we would like to hide.
 
 By default, IOBit Protected Folder hides the indicated data in such a way that they are not visible from the Explorer's system level or any other application. However, the method of securing data can be changed in the tool options. There are modes available that only allow you to block read or write files. The list of exclusions was also provided to the user.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows 30 program launches.
 By default, the program is run in the English language version. Interface changes to the Polish can be made from the configuration options.
