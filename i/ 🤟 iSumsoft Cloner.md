> iSumsoft Cloner is a small but effective tool whose main function is to clone data stored on the hard disk. Using it, we will also create a backup of the partition and, if necessary, we will restore data from it, and also transfer the operating system with the installed software to a new hard disk.

Copying and restoring data
 
 The program is not complicated and its operation should not cause problems even for less experienced users. After starting up, just select the mode you want - Copy, Backup or Restore. Thanks to them, it is possible to properly transfer the contents of the selected partition to other partitions, to create a partition backup and to restore it in the event of a data warehouse failure, for example. In most cases, the user only needs to define a few basic options, i.e. the source and target partitions.
 
 When to use iSumsoft Cloner?
 
 Scenarios for the use of the described tool can be many. The tool will certainly prove useful at the moment when we would like to quickly secure valuable data before losing it, transfer the contents of the partition to another disk or copy the system partition 1: 1 when replacing a computer or hard disk (eg from an ordinary disk to a fast SSD).
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program only for 7 days.
