iTALC (short for: intelligently Teaching And Learning with Computer) is a free tool for remote control and computer management, created for school computer rooms. It gives the teacher the opportunity to exercise comprehensive control over workstations running Windows and Linux.

The program was written in C ++ using the Qt library. All available functions are implemented using the RFB protocol using a TCP connection. In most cases, iTALC is used to control computers located within a local area network, such as a school classroom, but it also allows the student to connect to the computer at home - a VPN connection is used for this purpose. The tool works well in mixed environments, including workstations with Windows and Linux.
 
 iTALC allows remote execution of such operations as viewing the activity of users on client stations, remote assistance and troubleshooting, taking screenshots, displaying teacher screen contents on students' computers, blocking selected computers, sending text messages, remote turning off and turning on workstations, and performing any operations or scripts. 
 
 It is worth noting the support of the multi-core processor tool. The advantage is also the application of effective compression algorithms in the program, allowing for smooth operation even in the case of connections with remote computers that do not have a fast internet connection.Attention!
 
 The installation wizard suggests installing an additional toolbar and replacing the start page and the default search engine in your web browser. Deselecting the appropriate options, however, avoids installing these components.
