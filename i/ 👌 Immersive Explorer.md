Immersive Explorer is not an ordinary file manager, whose design is made in a tile style under Windows 8. This application was conceived by developers as a definite alternative to the standard built-in Windows Explorer. The start window offers basic bookmarks for quick access to your video files, pictures, music, downloads, icons of all available disks, including CD / DVD and USB, are also displayed.

Immersive Explorer does not offer any special features for working with files, only basic commands are available, such as opening, copying, moving, renaming, deleting, properties, etc. You can also view images and play music files directly from the program. It should be noted that you can install the application as usual in the system, and create a portable version.
