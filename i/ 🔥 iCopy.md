iCopy is a free utility that allows you to turn a scanner and printer of any manufacturer, into a copy machine. The program supports scanners with an automatic paper feeder, which makes it easy to scan a large number of pages at a time, and also makes it possible to save the scanned file in JPEG format. iCopy has a minimum of settings (number of copies, color, paper size, etc.), and can also be used as a portable application.
