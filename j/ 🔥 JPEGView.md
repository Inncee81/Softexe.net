The application, despite its small size, offers the user functionality, which certainly would not be ashamed of even commercial solutions of this type. In addition to the ability to view graphics, display it in full-screen mode with EXIF ​​data (it is also possible to edit them), the presentation of a set of photos as a slide show or movie, it also gives the possibility of their simple manipulation and processing. Using JPEGView, we will rotate the image by a given angle, create a mirror image, correct photo attributes such as brightness, contrast, saturation or color saturation, etc. Moreover, the program offers interesting autocorrect image functions that automatically adjusts the aforementioned parameters, thereby increasing the quality of the presented graphics.
 
 The advantage of this small graphical browser is very much. Small size, low demand for system resources and very fast operation (even with RAW files) mean that it can also be used on older computers. Importantly, the application provides the ability to convert RAW files to the popular JPEG format, thus being an alternative to frequently paid RAW converters.
 
 The full list of graphic formats supported by JPEGView includes JPG, JPEG, BMP, PNG, TIF, TIFF, GIF, WEBP, WDP, HDP, JXR, PEF, DNG, CRW, NEF, CR2, MRW, RW2, ORF, X3F, ARW, KDC, NRW, DCR, SR2 and RAF.
