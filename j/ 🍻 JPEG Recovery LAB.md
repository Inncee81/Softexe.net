JPEG Recovery LAB is not a difficult program to use, because the interface is based on a wizard that guides you through the next steps of the restore operation. It is enough to indicate the medium or disk image, choose the type of materials we want to recover (not only the pictures and videos, but also archives, etc.), define other settings (including maximum file size and image resolution), and then click " start".
 
 After the JPEG scanning operation completes, the LAB will generate a list of materials that can be recovered. However, before we decide to recover photos or videos, we will be able to see them in the preview.
 
 Among the graphic file formats supported by JPEG Recovery LAB we can find: JPG (JPEG), CR2 (Canon RAW) and NEF (Nikon RAW). When it comes to movies, the tool supports the following extensions: MOV, MP4, AVI, MPEG-2 (AVCHD, MTS) and DAV (also known as DHAV).
