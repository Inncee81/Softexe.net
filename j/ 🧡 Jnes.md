The program emulates both graphics and sounds in launched productions, offering the opportunity to play alone or with other players in the multiplayer mode. In the case of Android 4.0 or newer it is necessary to turn on Bluetooth, while on the emulator the emulator uses the Kailler tool. Jnes is compatible with PAL (Europe) and NTSC (United States, Japan) games.
 
 Jnes provides fast emulation using OpenGL hardware acceleration, advanced graphics scaling using pixel shaders, stereo sound, fast scrolling (2x), and supports compressed ZIP files and NES files. Players will appreciate that the program allows you to save your progress at any time and synchronize them via the Dropbox service.
 
 The mobile version of the Jnes emulator includes a user interface designed for the aforementioned tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices. It is also possible to use gameplay codes on the popular Game Genie website, courtesy of Gent. The program also includes the Pro-Action-Replay database.
 
 Jnes easily handles the support of MOGA Pro, MOGA Hero controllers and pocket gamepads. It is worth noting that the application does not support control devices connected under USB in Android 4.4 (KitKat). Interestingly, it is also possible to use touch screens on mobile devices.
