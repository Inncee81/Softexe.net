The whole was implemented in the form of a transparent wizard, thanks to which less experienced users will also be able to handle JSoft PDF Reducer. It is enough to put a given file in the main program window (by selecting it from the hard disk or using the "drag and drop" technique), and then select the options visible on the screen.
 
 JSoft PDF Reducer allows you to change the quality of the document depending on whether you plan to print it or just browse it on the monitor. It is also possible to change the order of pages, remove unnecessary parts, add and delete text, and even protect PDFs with a password or watermark.
