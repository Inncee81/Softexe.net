Joplin is a free tool for creating notes, which is characterized by a modern, transparent user interface.

After starting the Joplin application, create a notepad in which we will store your entries. You can add an attachment to the text, or even tag it to make it easier to find the note later. It is worth noting that the program includes an option to encrypt data with a password using the E2EE protection, which is, by default, disabled and we can manually activate it in the menu of the described tool.
 
 Interestingly, Joplin has an option to synchronize notes via services such as Dropbox or OneDrive. Thanks to this function - after installing the program on a different computer or any portable device - all our notes will appear on every platform. It turns out to be particularly useful when, for example, we need to create a large note and intend to use it on the phone, where entering the next words turns out to be much more time-consuming than using the keyboard.
 
 Joplin allows you to export data to JEX, RAW and PDF formats and import data from files saved as JEX, MD, RAW and ENEX.
