The program primarily allows you to crop, rotate and crop images, but also offers several other functions. With the help of the application, we will not only remove unnecessary fragments of a given photo or graphic, but also add an additional filter with a gray effect, zoom in or out the photo and remove unnecessary edges. We will do all these operations without losing the quality of the source file.
 
 Jpegcrop works in a standard window, where we can load files, modify them in various ways, and then save. There is also an option to print individual JPGs. Unfortunately, for many users, the disadvantage of the program may be the fact that it does not allow you to edit several images at the same time.
 
 It is worth mentioning that Jpegcrop does not require installation on the hard disk and does not leave any data in the operating system registry. The application is available in a portable version, which means that we can run it directly from a device connected to a computer via USB.
