The data entry assistant is a special module present in the QR-Code Studio, thanks to which we will implement the necessary data in the code. QR codes allow us to download a variety of content from the Internet or launch a specific website, appear also on admission tickets, and even allow you to use the wireless network or discounts in selected retail chains.
 
 Thanks to many customization options, we can prepare a QR code according to your preferences by specifying the size of the symbol, its width and height, module width, colors, resolution and margins. QR-Code Studio also allows you to add text located above and below the QR code.
 
 After finishing the work, we will be able to copy the QR code to the clipboard or export it to a graphic file in BMP, GIF, JPG, PNG or TIFF format.
