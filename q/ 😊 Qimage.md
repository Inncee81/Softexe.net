> Qimage is a useful tool whose task is to support photo printing on a computer. Due to the large number of useful functions it is directed mainly to all types of graphic artists or photographers, but nothing prevents the application from being used also for amateur prints at home.

The program has been equipped with almost all necessary functions that you would expect from a solution of this type. The user has been given tools to adjust the exposure, eliminate bad pixels or many other imperfections of the photograph, as well as the printing itself in various modes. In addition to the majority of the most popular graphic formats, Qimage also supports RAW files created by more professional cameras and so-called. SLR. From the level of the application, we will also perform a wholesale file renaming operation.
 
 In addition to the aforementioned Qimage functions, it will also be useful when we want to display a slideshow or conveniently send our pictures to friends via e-mail.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 14 days. Other restrictions include the ability to work with up to four photos in one session and no RAW support.
