With the help of Quantum GIS, we will also be able to design maps containing information on geographical coordinates, perform spatial analyzes, prepare your own data files and much, much more. The program contains a lot of useful options enabling even filtering of presented messages, thanks to which we will only see the elements we need on the screen.
 
 Quantum GIS was constructed in such a way that the user could at any time develop the functionality of the program using plugins, such as, for example, GRASS, OpenLayers and Georeferencer.
