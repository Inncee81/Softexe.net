Individual user documents prepared using QOwnNotes are stored on the computer hard drive in the form of ordinary text files with the option of encrypting them. Notes can not only create and save, but also delete and share. There is also an option to restore previous versions of given files. If we have a large database, we can easily find the necessary content using the built-in search engine. The function will also make it easier for us to use keyboard shortcuts.
 
 The tool allows you to synchronize content between devices, thanks to which we will gain access to them not only on the desktop, but also on a laptop or smartphone or tablet. In this case, the application supports both ownCloud and Nextcloud, but nothing prevents you from using Dropbox, Seafile or BitTorrent Sync. If we want to edit notes via the network, we will be able to use ownCloud Notes.
