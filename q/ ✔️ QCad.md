> QCad is a commercial program for computer-aided design with a long tradition, whose development was temporarily stopped in 2009. In October 1999, Ribbonsoft began work on the CAM Expert program, which became the basis of QCada developed since May 2002.

The program offers all the necessary tools to design, from editing shapes, through scoops and text tools to the ability to attract shapes, advanced functions of zooming the view and interesting functions modifying existing objects. Objects can be placed on layers and grouped.
 
 New in this version of the program is support for Wacom tablets and Apple Magic Trackpad devices. In addition, the user has a collection of 4800 parts (screws, rivets), which you can expand and view yourself from the built-in part explorer. The project can be viewed in an isometric view. In addition, the program has a script interface compatible with ECMAScript and its dedicated IDE and integrated user's manual.
 
 
 The program supports reading and writing formats DXF R12 and DXF 200x, export to SVG and PDF, and import and export of various raster formats (BMP, JPG, PNG and others).
