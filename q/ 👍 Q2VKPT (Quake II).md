> Q2VKPT is an experimental version of Quake II, introducing real ray tracing to the old game. This is associated with a significant increase in the hardware requirements of the game, but the effects are worth it.

The classic Quake II uses ray tracking and track tracking to generate dynamic lighting. The same methods are used in modern animated films. The game shows the possibilities of the VK_NV_ray_tracing library and also works on Linux.
 
 
 To run Q2VKPT at 1440p and 60 fps, you need at least GeForce RTX 2080 Ti.
