> Better File Rename is an easy-to-use tool for renaming selected files on a computer with a Windows operating system.

After running Better File Rename, just add individual documents or entire directories (eg by drag-and-drop) and then define file rename rules. The user can prefix it with a prefix or suffix, and add text, characters, tags or many other elements, modifying not only the file name itself, but also their extensions.
 
 Once we've set the options, we'll be able to start the rename operation by clicking the "perform renames" button. Better File Rename can of course work in batch mode, modifying the names of hundreds or even thousands of documents in a short time.
