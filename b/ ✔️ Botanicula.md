The story presents the fate of five friends embarking on a journey to save the last seeds of a native tree infected by parasites. The script takes on an interesting and serious subject matter, but in essence Botanicula is a production full of humor. Noteworthy is also a very refined visual design, which can be admired, exploring over 150 locations.
 
 
 Botanicula contains a classic gameplay based on the point and click interface, and the game itself is addressed not only to fans of the genre, but also to other, both younger and older users. However, it should be remembered that some puzzles can be extremely difficult, but much more often, less complicated puzzles appear here.
