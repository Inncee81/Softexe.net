Betternet is a very easy to use tool, thanks to which we will protect your privacy while using the Internet, as well as gain access to websites blocked in specific geographic regions.

After installing the Betternet program, we will be able to anonymously navigate the network (change of IP address will occur), which means that our activity will not be detected by hackers; the websites will also not appear annoying ads. Therefore, our personal data will be completely safe, regardless of whether we use a private or public Wi-Fi network, browsing Facebook or performing online transactions using a payment card.
 
 
 For various reasons, providers of individual websites block access to their content to users from selected countries (some of them may be censored, others blocked by a school or an employer). Betternet tolerates this limitation, so we have access to all websites from around the world.
