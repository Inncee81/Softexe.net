```sh
Black Hole Benchmark is a free application (so-called benchmark) used to check the performance of the computer, mainly the processor you have. The program checks user equipment at several angles: Singlethread (performance of a single thread), 4 Thread (mainly designed for performance in computer games) and Multithread (performance with many simultaneous threads of the processor),

By performing a total of three tests (one event for each of them), we get a reliable result determining the performance of your computer. One downside of Black Hole Benchmark is that it is a benchmark designed only for 32-bit systems, which is a limitation. The program makes up for it with a simple interface that you do not need any great skills to handle. It should be remembered that during testing, the application may not respond for a while, and the system respond with a long delay - this is a normal phenomenon that passes after a few minutes when all benchmark tasks are completed.
 
 The program does not require installation - simply unpack the downloaded archive and run the application. The obtained results can also be sent to the Black Hole Benchmark website, where you can compare your results with other users.
