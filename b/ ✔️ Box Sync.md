> Box Sync is a client application of the Box.com virtual disk service, allowing automatic synchronization of data between the computer and external servers in the cloud.

The program is very easy to use and allows you to store 10 GB of data in a free virtual disk package. The data is synchronized between a special folder created during the installation of Box Sync and servers located in the cloud. The service does not limit in any way the type of stored data, enabling the upload of documents, photos, multimedia, etc., whose size of a single file does not exceed 250 MB.
 
 Box Sync is an almost maintenance-free tool. All operations, i.e. moving and deleting data from a virtual disk, take place via the local My Box Files directory.
 
 Unfortunately, the functionality of the application is very poor and only allows you to set limits on the transfer / upload data. Folders included in the synchronization process and sharing and sharing of directories can be configured only from the web interface of the service in the browser window.
