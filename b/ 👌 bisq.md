> Bisq (formerly Bitsquare) is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange - bitcoin, monero, litecoin and others - which only mediates exchanges between its users. All funds remain in portfolios controlled only by their owners, and safe deposits are implemented by multi-signature bitcoin addresses. Of course, it is also possible to use traditional currencies (dollars, euros or zlotys) in transactions, for example using bank transfers (but not only).

Developers of this open source project develop it completely according to the will of users - it is a decentralized organization in which binding decisions are made by shareholder voting, carried out using special BSQ tokens.
 
 
 
 Thanks to this, Bisq does not need any registration or verification of users, operates independently of any offices, and the transactions it contains can not be blocked or censored. All communication is indeed encrypted and redirected through the Tor network to avoid the interest of prying third parties. Thanks to this, no one but partners in the transaction will know their data, and they reveal only what they consider necessary. All problems are resolved through a decentralized arbitration system.
 
 The application is distinguished by a convenient and transparent interface, to create an account (our data is stored only locally) and you do not need practically any technical knowledge to start trading.
