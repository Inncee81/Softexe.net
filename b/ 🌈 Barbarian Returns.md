> Long before the series such as Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter became permanently on the market, the computer people were already fighting. One of the undoubted hits of the Commodore 64 splendor and not only was Barbarian: The Ultimate Warrior. There was no choice of colored characters. You played simply in one of two muscular barbarians. The Barbarian Returns project is a return to old times.

Two warriors enter the arena in stature resembling the famous Conan. They wield big swords in their hands. We play with a friend or a computer opponent, and the title also supports playing in the local network. The goal is to defeat your rival by sending him blows, until all the health bullets are visible in the corner of the screen. The blows are dealt with at the touch of a button, but it does not mean that the game is simple.
 
 
 Depending on the direction you hold, the attack will be carried out in a different way. The most dangerous is the attack from behind the head, because if we do not manage to block it ourselves, we can be shortened to the arms. With a bit of luck, the clash can be ended with one swipe of the blade, but usually it will not be so easy. In most fights, there will be gradual torments and bleeding of the opponent.
