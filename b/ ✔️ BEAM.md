BEAM is a nice, free 2D platformer that focuses on skill and logical thinking. The slightly retro-styled item presents easy-to-learn rules and a simple scheme of operation, but it does not mean that it is easy to pass.

We are directing the movements of a certain gentleman whose main task is to reach in one piece to get out of each, even the most complicated system.
 
 The basis of the game is traversing underground labyrinths, defeating all kinds of obstacles, blockades and ambushes. The advantage of our hero is the ability to teleport to a specific, selected place on the board using mirrors and teleports. However, he must watch out for ubiquitous, dangerous lasers and mobile platforms.
 
 Along with the duration of the game, the level of difficulty increases, the challenges become more and more complex, and in each subsequent layout more and more daunting tasks await.
 
 The design is characterized by an economical, but at the same time impressive visual setting. It is a good combination of logic, platform and arcade games while presenting many interesting aspects typical of these species.
