Business Tour is a digital board game that evokes associations with iconic Monopoly because of the appearance of the board itself and the rules of the game.

The whole was designed in such a way as to allow simultaneous play for up to four players. Business Tour does not allow for lonely gameplay, but multiplayer is available both online and offline. We can invite family members, friends and acquaintances to the game, or search for people on the web.
 
 Business Tour is an "easy to learn, hard to master" production. The rules will be mastered in a hurry, but to win you should demonstrate tactical sense and the ability to manage the available budget. The key to success is not only strategic planning of subsequent activities, but also predicting the movements of other players.
 
 It is worth noting that Business Tour operates in the free-to-play business model. The game can be downloaded for free, but on Steam you will find many paid extras, which offer, among others new characters or currency to be used during the game.
