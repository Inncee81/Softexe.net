> Free clones of the classic Arkanoid is very much, but some proposals by independent artists surprise you more. This group includes a free project with an inconspicuous Block title. The name is not so much about capturing colorful blocks visible on the screen, but also trying to block the escape of the balls at the bottom. At the same time, the whole mass can reflect all around.

Very quickly, innovative ideas are introduced that have been introduced to the iconic formula. At each level, we have a certain number of balls, which are also our lives. However, you can fire a few at once, risking more, but also quickly removing objects on the screen. When we combine it with the bricks, which also fall out of the balls, the sweet chaos quickly sets in a little stunned.
 
 
 Of course, there were special powers falling from above. The pad can, for example, be enlarged to the entire width of the screen, which combined with the momentary unlimited supply of balls and let's say turning them into bowling balls allows you to admire what is happening and relax. The levels themselves are also surprising. Of course, there are bricks with various properties, but it also happens to programmers to play with gravity as well.
