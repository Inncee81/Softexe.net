> Bewilder House is a free proposition for those players who are not afraid to move their head, and at the same time are also able to cope with quite the thrill of emotions. This free production is an adventure game with a dark color. Although the action takes place in an abandoned amusement park, we will not be uninspired to enjoy it here. We have to escape from it, being careful of the crazy clown.

We observe the world through the eyes of a prisoner among colorful walls, an adult person whose children apparently prepared such a fate. Things will clear up much later. The main purpose of the fun is to get out of a given part of the park designed to be confused at every step. Orientation in the field is facilitated by special handy maps dividing rooms into squares. We need to reach the green marked.
 
 
 For each challenge we get a separate computer with a map. From the very beginning it is not easy. Despite the fact that the characteristic points are taken into account, allowing to reach where the hero is located, the curtain system cuts off access to the rooms. There are also confusing carousels. Immediately afterwards, the game commands to look around well, introducing the clown to the fun ... You can be scared.
