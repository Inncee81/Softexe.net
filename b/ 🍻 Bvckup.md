Application developers decided that it is better to be great in one element than the medium in many aspects and that's why their work does not have many unnecessary functions. We will not find any mechanisms to compress, encrypt or decrypt or copy files to an FTP server. Instead, Bvckup does one thing: it creates the perfect copy from place A in place B. And it does it really well. The operation of the program is simple thanks to the neatly designed user interface.
 
 The program is characterized by a high speed of operation, in which a large merit of working in delta mode - it allows you to save a lot of time when copying large files by updating previously made files, instead of loading the file from scratch. Parts of the file that have not been changed will not be copied, allowing you to get faster copies. The program can run in the background and make subsequent copies according to the schedule. Bvckup copes well with systems equipped with multi-core processors.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 14 days.
