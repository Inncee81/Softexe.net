The application offers an extremely convenient and functional user interface through which we can add and update archives by drag and drop. Bitser is fully compatible with Windows Explorer and thanks to this we also get quick access to the most important program functions from the context menu in Windows. 
 
 
 Bitser creates archives in ZIP, 7-ZIP and EXE formats, as well as the ability to create self-extracting archives (SFX). In addition, it unpacks data from the following file formats - ZIP, zipx, 7Z, RAR, ISO, VHD, MSI, GZIP, BZIP2, TAR, DEB, DMG, LZH, LZMA, LZMA2, PPMd, NSIS, RPM and UDF. The program also has a built-in password manager and a tool for checking checksums in files (MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256).
 
 
 Bitser allows you to perform full or partial conversion of archived files to other formats. It creates compressed backups of data, secures archives using the advanced AES-256 bit encryption algorithm, and supports multithreading on multiprocessor and multi-core systems. Creates reports displaying the entire history of archived files in the program and finds and deletes all empty folders from the context menu.
