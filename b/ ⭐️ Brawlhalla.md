```sh
Brawlhalla is a free proposition for all those who are looking for quite an interesting party fight, modeled on the occasion of such a console, that is a fight for several people on multi-level arenas. In the foreground there is always a fast action, with fast chain of blows directed at opponents by various beautifully drawn two-dimensional figures.

Fun is possible here in several modes. The basic one is a multi-person sofa madness, meaning the competition of players sitting in front of the computer shoulder to shoulder, with the possible participation of bots, or computer-controlled fighters. We also have the option of playing alone, but the most enjoyable is the online gameplay, where the 8 fighters get really hot. If someone is dreaming of a championship, there are also rankings of the best players. There are also games on own terms.
 
 
 There are over 20 characters to choose from, each carefully animated and offering other plays or special powers. They are modeled on the classic heroes of comics, cartoons or books, with knights, aliens, pirates or minotaurs, to name a few. In addition, various powerful weapons were scattered on the arenas. The project is being developed from micro-transactions, but purchases for real money do not affect the course of battles. One can buy here mainly alternative costumes for heroes.
 
 
 Young and ambitious producers ensure that Brawlhalla will be constantly developed, because they also intend to strongly promote their production as an ideal position for eSports tournaments. In popularizing the title, of course, the Free-2-Play model can help, in which it was released. With a free game, there is no barrier to play. You just have to install a brawl and try it if it's something for the player.

 Attention!
 
 In order to install the game, you should download the Steam program - a special online platform that allows you not only to buy and download computer games, but also to stay in touch with friends, which we can, for example, invite you to the game.
