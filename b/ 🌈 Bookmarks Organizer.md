> Bookmarks Organizer is an extension for Firefox, whose task is to find bookmarks that can cause problems, ie containing redirects, wrong addresses or duplicates in different folders with tabs. To do this, after starting the extension, you should initiate a bookmark check.

The extension will display the number of checked tabs broken down into those containing errors (marked in red) and generating warnings (yellow). The analysis results can be long, but you can search and filter them.
 
 Each of the items will be marked with a color suitable for the problem. With each of them we will also find the possibility of fixing - for example, deleting one with a broken link or changing an empty description. In many cases, the extension is able to improve links to pages with redirection, but experience shows that it is not always good.
