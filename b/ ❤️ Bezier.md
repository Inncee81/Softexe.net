Bezier is an extremely dynamic and addictive 2D shooting in a great sound setting. The game is uncomplicated and simple in rules, but it is very strict in terms of skill.

The player moves a small vehicle on a static board, trying to implement a classic scenario for this type of position consisting in breaking down as many enemy ships as possible with minimal losses.
 
 The main axis of the game is to conduct continual attacks on specific enemy bases, to which a special radar leads. In the meantime, we are attacked by alien bodies that successfully defend our offensive. The system arrives on the opponents' system, and the tasks set before us - especially that they are to be performed on time - begin to overwhelm our capabilities.
 
 The game features 15 battlefields, several different game modes, three levels of difficulty, over a hundred types of opponents, as well as a system of achievements with the possibility of expanding weapons; and all this with music that matches the atmosphere of the game, matching the climate. The action itself is full of spectacular explosions, explosions, shots, streams of fire, lasers and many other futuristic phenomena.
 
 Bezier is an uncommon and captivating production that sometimes requires superhuman fitness, brilliance and cunning. It is another example of how traveling in outer space combined with the mission of total extermination of an opponent is a timeless subject that seems never to be able to change.
