Best Free Keylogger is a free tool to record the activity of other users on your computer.

Monitoring of activities takes place in this case without the knowledge of the person using the PC on which Best Free Keylogger was installed. The program allows you to track user activity on the internet, register keystrokes pressed by him (including logins and passwords and messages sent by communicators), as well as running processes.
 
 It is worth noting that the Best Free Keylogger can be "called" using the combination of "ctrl + alt + shift + k" buttons to start tracking immediately. Recording activity can also take place according to the schedule (eg during business hours from 8 to 16). The information obtained by the described tool can be obtained, inter alia, by e-mail or FTP server.
 
 The Best Free Keylogger - according to the manufacturer - is undetectable. The application will not appear in the list of programs to be removed in the Control Panel (we can uninstall it from the settings of the described tool or automatically in the set time), and in the Task Manager it appears under another, discreet name.
