Blue-Cloner is an extensive software for backing up data saved on Blu-Ray media. It allows you to copy data to Blu-Ray, DVD, AVCHD discs or to the computer's hard disk.

This program allows you to convert files saved on a Blu-Ray disc to DVD-5/9 format, folders, ISO images, and - of course - allows you to create a 1: 1 copy of any media. All of course without losing quality. In addition, files available on your computer's hard drive can be burned to any Blu-Ray media, provided that we have the right drive.
 
 Blue-Cloner includes two types of interface: express and advanced. The first one is addressed to users who want to copy a disc with a single click, while the second one is equipped with a number of advanced options - of course, in this case, the operation takes much longer, because you have to spend time configuring various settings.
 
 It is worth adding that when copying a Blu-Ray movie using Blue-Cloner, we can omit all unnecessary functions (eg title menu), putting only the video file on the disc without losing quality. In addition, if you do not have a 50-GB disc, there is the option to divide the image into two smaller ones, 25 GB each.
 
 Blue-Cloner copes well with all security features, thanks to which we will copy every protected medium. It does not require any plugins, drivers or additional tools to perform this operation. In the case of backups, however, you need to connect to the Internet.
 
 Attention!
 The trial version allows you to make only one copy of the Blu-ray media.
