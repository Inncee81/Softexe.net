The tool offers many possibilities for designing new fonts. The whole process takes place on a special grid, which is the main working window of the described program. On the right side of the minimalist interface, we find a number of devices (pencil, various types of lines, rectangles, circles, as well as a magnifying glass), thanks to which we can design any type of font. There is an uncomplicated but powerful graphical editor available.
 
 It would seem that Birdfont is reserved exclusively for experienced users. It is worth explaining that the application has been designed so that novices can also use it.
