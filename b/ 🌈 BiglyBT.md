Just like alternative solutions of this type, BiglyBT allows downloading simultaneously many files, the size of which can be almost unlimited. The offered functions allow the user to queue the data to be downloaded, pause / resume downloading at any time, as well as limiting the incoming / outgoing transfer. There was also a tool to view the torrent downloaded along with a given file or a very convenient, built-in torrent search engine.
 
 BiglyBT was created in Java language which ensures multi-platform program. The undoubted advantage of the application is the lack of any built-in advertising components.
