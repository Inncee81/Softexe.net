> BenchMe is an exceptionally easy-to-use benchmark for drives that allows you to test the speed of reading data from SSD, HDD, but also portable memory and memory cards. It also displays information on whether the media supports selected control technologies, including SMART

Testing should start with indicating the list of media to be tested. It displays both all partitions of the computer (including volume names, which is not obvious in this type of software) and portable media connected to the computer.
 
 After choosing the right disk, all you have to do is press the big Start button . The data reading speed test will start, displaying the results on the graph. The minimum and maximum value reached are also marked. In the case of SSD disks, the whole test does not last longer than several dozen or so seconds.
 
 The program will therefore work great mainly in situations when we want to quickly check the read performance of the disk.
