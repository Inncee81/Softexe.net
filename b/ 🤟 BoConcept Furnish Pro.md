The idea of ​​using the program is the same as in other Geac Computers production tools created on behalf of furniture concerns. We apply individual elements of equipment to the defined surface, and the effect of our planning can be seen in a three-dimensional visualization. However, in this case, we can use the catalog of universal furniture, such as sofas, armchairs, dressers, wardrobes, lamps, etc., in contrast to, for example, IKEA tools that allow only for the design of kitchens and offices.
 
 Unfortunately, so far, BoConcept does not provide the Polish language version of the program.Attention!
 
 Information about salons in our country can be obtained on the Polish BoConcept website .
