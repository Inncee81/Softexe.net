> Basemark GPU is a tool for testing graphics cards that support Vulkan 1.0, OpenGL 4.5 or OpenGL ES 3.1.

Using the Basemark GPU, we can check the performance of the system by carrying out the so-called "Official test", where we choose graphical API and texture compression, but nothing prevents us from adapting various parameters according to our own needs in the "custom" tab. By opting for this solution, we will be able to additionally determine the image resolution and the quality of the presented content (medium or high). It is worth adding that, similarly to other programs of this type, the "experience" mode was also available at the Basemark GPU.
 
 After finishing work, the Basemark GPU displays detailed information about the results achieved in the test. Presented is the overall score, as well as the number of displayed frames per second (minimum, average and maximum) at the set parameters. These values ​​are also shown in the form of a clear table.
