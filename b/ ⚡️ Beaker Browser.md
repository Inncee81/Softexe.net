```sh
Beaker Browser is a free web browser. We're dealing here with an experimental tool that also allows you to design and share network sites using peer-to-peer connections.

It is worth noting that in Beaker Browser we get support for the Dat protocol, thanks to which individual websites and files (including even documents or applications) are sent using the mentioned solution (in this case it is an HTTP replacement). So if we want to publish your website, we do not need to have a server because thanks to Beaker Browser we will make it available directly from your computer.
 
 Beaker Browser, despite being significantly different from other programs of this type, offers solutions characteristic of them, enabling free use of the network. We will be able to open various pages in tabs, add selected addresses to bookmarks, configure an RSS reader and much, much more.
