The tool offers 2 benchmark modes - quick 'Quick' and thorough 'Complete'. Both of them are very demanding for the mentioned components and testing the computer with their use may last from 30 minutes and up (depending on the efficiency of your equipment). In addition, after running Blender Benchmark, the user can choose which component to test - CPU or GPU. The software allows you to examine the computer's capabilities in terms of rendering and working with demanding programs for modeling 3D animations (eg popular Blender ).
 
 The producer along with the release of Blender Benchmark also made available the Blender Open Data web platform in which we can publish the results of our own tests anonymously, as well as compare them with other users.
