```sh
After years of being a bad character in games from the Angry Birds series, green piglets finally got their own production. Bad Piggies is a departure from the arcade formula of shooting from a sling into enemies for logical thinking and DIY. Here, the pig has to get to the finish line quite a strange, self-made vehicle. The distribution of individual elements is, however, a matter of the player's taste.

Each level starts with the design of something that usually resembles a small car. In free, indicated fields, put different parts so that it has arms and legs or rather wheels and a motor. Then we put the pig in the center, and then we try to reach the end line, collecting various bonuses along the way. One plus journey time translates into the number of stars earned in each stage.
 
 
 A simple idea, and a lot of fun. At first you need to use blacksmith bellows as the driving force. Gradually, their place will begin to occupy more advanced ideas, such as a few bottles of soda or just a fan. Importantly, the car does not have to survive in its entirety. The most important thing is for the driver to roll over the finish line. Sometimes it just does not get to the end otherwise.
 
 Limitations of the trial version
 
 The trial version offers you to play dozens of stages, which the player gradually unlocks. This gives a really big insight into the mechanics of the game.
