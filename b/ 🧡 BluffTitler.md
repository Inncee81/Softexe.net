The program consists of an extensive toolbar and an advanced editor that also acts as a player. On the special bar you will find all the most important tools and options, through which we will create a title scene and add various effects. In the program, we get access to a huge number of different layers that will allow us to add or change the right image, textures, additional text, particles and visual effects, and many other graphic elements.
 
 
 Users can easily undo all changes made, recreate the created project using the built-in player, and fully modify and manipulate individual layers. They can also be accelerated, slowed down, cloned and positioned. In addition, we also operate the camera and set its location on the created title scene. 
 
 
 Finished projects can be exported to a graphic or video file (AVI). BluffTitler also offers the option of resizing the show (resolution, diagonal, view), scaling the image, adding and modifying the smoothing of the edges, setting the appropriate lighting and the length of the recording. The program has access to an online guide and various finished projects created by other users of the application.  
 
 Attention!
 The program is available in a demo version, which introduced restrictions related to saving the created project. In addition, there is a watermark in the program editor.BluffTitler is also available in the Polish language version. To activate the polonized interface, enter the appropriate path in the configuration options with access to the polonization file (by default, the file is located in the directory: c: \ Outerspace Software \ BluffTitler \ Media \ Locales \ polish.txt)
