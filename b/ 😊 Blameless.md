```sh
Blameless is a short but difficult game in which the architect tries to solve the mystery hidden in the house being built. The specialist was invited to consult the improvements in the building. Watching him, he notices blood stains on the floor, gets in the head and wakes up alone in a closed room. Does he need a door to get out of it?

The game consists of puzzles that have to be solved using the nearby objects, as well as tips that will help to solve the dark secret. Some locations give the player a choice and have several "solutions", not all items will be useful in the next steps of the game. 
 
 
 The game has been designed to keep the player in suspense, although the traditional action is not much here. There is a lot of searching for useful items and hidden details.
 
 Good soundtracking of the game and romantic music deepen the dark and mysterious atmosphere.
