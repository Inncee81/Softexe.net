The program operates based on the parsing method (content analysis). After downloading collections once, he saves them in his database, allowing the user to work with them offline. Access to the application and stored information on the status of our account (including the number of operations, sum of credits / charges, current balance) is possible only after entering the username and password. In addition, Bankonet allows you to determine the status and affiliation to groups for each transaction on the account, and also has an extensive (often updated) database of banks and their branches throughout Poland. The advantage of the program is the search function, which makes it very easy to search the statements in accordance with the criteria set by the user - eg the name of the contractor, payment title, account number or transaction amount.
 
 Unfortunately, Bankonet does not allow defining online transfers. Allegro payment support appeared in the new version.Attention!
 The trial version does not introduce any functional restrictions and allows you to use the program for a period of 60 days.
