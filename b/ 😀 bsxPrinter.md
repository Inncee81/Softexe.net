The software is addressed to the owners of online stores and enables them to expand the functionality of the system used with the option of printing receipts for orders and / or fiscalisation of invoices generated by the store. The creator also encourages the creators of their own stores and various types of applications to integrate their platform and easily extend its capabilities to support fiscal printers from leading manufacturers.
 
 Functions of the bsxPrinter program
 
 TCP / IP server - bsxPrinter starts its own TCP / IP server. Any application (be it native or web) can connect to it and issue appropriate commands - thus printing receipts or invoices on fiscal printers
 HTTP / HTTPS server - bsxPrinter starts its own HTTP server. Any application can then call the specified URL and pass the appropriate parameters using the POST method. In this way, you can easily integrate with bsxPrinter from any web page
 Folder Monitor - bsxPrinter can follow a constantly selected folder. If it detects files with a specific extension (.in or .xml) in it, it will automatically process them and print a fiscal document based on them. Instead of connecting to bsxPrinter, you can simply create the right files in the selected folder
 FTP and SFTP monitor - bsxPrinter can connect to any FTP or SFTP server and observe the selected folder there. Analogously to the Folder Monitor solution - when it detects specific files there, it will process them and print the corresponding receipts
 XML exchange - bsxPrinter can call cyclically specified address (or URLs) URL, under which you can prepare your own script. Your script should return the XML file with the description of the receipt to be printed. bsxPrinter will then call this URL again and give you information about the status of printing documents! You set the URL, frequency of checking, etc.
 
 Attention!
 
 The free version has a restriction allowing to issue up to 50 receipts a month.
