The program also contains a number of other options that can ensure safe use of the Internet for our child. An additional advantage of the program is extremely simple operation.
 
 Beniamin also allows you to trace the addresses of websites launched by a child during the absence of the program user. Control can go further, Beniamin allows you to define precisely the time in which the "supervised" can use the Internet (specific hours or maximum time). A very valuable functionality of the program is the ability to block downloading files. In this regard, Beniamin offers two options: blocking the downloading of executable files (it prevents the download of various types of dialers, and also reduces viral threats), you can also block the ability to download DOC, XLS, ZIP documents, etc., which may also potentially contain viruses.
 
 What is important for the user's convenience, Beniamin has the ability to temporarily disable, a user with full rights can disable its operation for example 60 minutes, work on the computer, and the guard will turn on after the indicated time itself again.
