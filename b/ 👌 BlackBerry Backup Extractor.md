BlackBerry Backup Extractor is a tool for opening and extracting information stored in the memory of smartphones belonging to the BlackBerry family. Thanks to it, we will create a backup copy of the data.

Movies, photos, applications, bookmarks, SMS messages, contacts, emails and many other data may be lost as a result of BlackBerry phone failure. To protect yourself against this, it's a good idea to install the BlackBerry Backup Extractor program on your computer and use it to store the information on your hard disk so that you can use it later if necessary.
 
 It is worth mentioning that BlackBerry Backup Extractor works with back-ups made by BlackBerry Desktop Manager (supported models are primarily BlackBerry Curve, Torch, Touch and Bold). 
 
 Data acquired before BlackBerry Backup Extractor is automatically converted to CSV, VCard or ICAL formats, so they can be easily and quickly imported into Excel, Outlook or Webmail.
