The AVCHD format allows you to play Blu-Ray movies on DVD5 or DVD9 media, while maintaining high quality audio and video (1080p). BDtoAVCHD works great as a backup tool for Blu-Ray discs on smaller media. The application compresses video content to the best possible quality, so that it can fit DVD5 (4.7 GB), DVD9 (8.5 GB), USB or BD-25. The user also has the option of specifying his own final file size. BDtoAVCHD calculates on the basis of a fixed file size what bitrate (99-100%) will fill the medium of the selected carrier.
 
 BDtoAVCHD does not use external codecs (such as avisynth, ffdshow, Haali splitter) for conversion thus allowing the playback of movies on most devices available on the market. The tool uses an efficient x264 64-bit decoder to decompress materials, in case the system supports it.
 
 In addition, the program automatically finds the movie file and extracts all data stored on the media including audio tracks, video, subtitles, chapters, etc. In the case of audio tracks BDtoAVCHD also allows you to compress PCM formats to AC3, DTS-HD MA to DTS Core, DTS to AC3 etc. BDtoAVCHD also offers the possibility of converting many materialsAttention!
 
 
 The program contains advertising components (adware). In this particular case, however, these components are harmless and safe for the user, and their operation is limited only to displaying the advertisement.
