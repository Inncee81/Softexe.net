The program offers a number of functions, including the creation of advanced family trees taking into account many data (name, surname, age, place of residence, etc.) with the possibility of exporting and importing to the GEDCOM format, adding photos, information about events from the lives of people, sources of these events, witnesses etc. The great advantage of the program is the construction of a base able to accommodate 10 million people. Finished projects of family trees can be easily printed, there are several ready-made schemes with the possibility of earlier preview.
