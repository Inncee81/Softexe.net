> Black Menu for Google is a plugin for the Google Chrome or Opera 15+ web browser, which is targeted at users who use Google services.

After installing the described add-on, the browser on the right side of the address bar will find a small icon, to which we have to click to open a list containing a list of Google services to which we can get instant access. As a result, we no longer need to manually run Google, Calendar, Google Play, Drive, Google+, Translator, Map, YouTube, News or Gmail manually.
 
 
 Black Menu for Google allows you to customize the contents of the list of services to your preferences, so we can only include the most frequently used sites belonging to Google in this extension (e.g., search engine, Google+ and Calendar). There is also a possibility to define many other settings (eg the default country for Google messages and the default map in Google Maps or selected languages ​​for Google Translate).
