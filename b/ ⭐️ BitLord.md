The program was written in C ++ and is characterized by high speed of operation and a negligible demand for system resources. It offers features that allow you to conveniently download files shared by other users at high speed, queue and download lots of data at the same time, prioritize them, interrupt and resume transfers, and impose limits on download speed and data upload. BitLord has been equipped with a torrent search engine, which significantly streamlines the search for files of interest to the user. There was also a built-in web browser.
 
 
 BitLord also offers a comment system that allows you to read the opinions of other users about a given file, and share your own insights. The application has a useful mechanism for automatic connection optimization in order to achieve the highest possible transfer, bypassing the firewall and NAT, blocking selected IP addresses and automatically shutting down the computer after downloading all files. 
 
 Attention!
 
 The program installation wizard offers the user to install additional components in the form of a toolbar and substitution of the default start page and search engine in a web browser. To avoid introducing the above changes, simply select the appropriate options in the installer.
 
 By default, the program is run in the English language version. If you want to use the Polish edition you should make appropriate changes to the settings.
