With it, in one place we will collect user names and passwords for e-mail account, credit card or popular social networking sites. Buttercup proves to be useful when we have many accounts in different places on the web, and we do not want to use one password (it is extremely dangerous), but from many complex sequences of characters that are difficult to remember.
  
 After starting to use the program, all you have to do is create a new archive protected with a general password, and then enter the necessary data, specifying the name of the entry (eg my email account), user data and password. Individual information can be assigned to specific directories, which will allow us to find the necessary logins and passwords easier.
  
 It is worth adding that Buttercup offers the possibility to import data saved in the formats kdbx, 1pif and csv.
