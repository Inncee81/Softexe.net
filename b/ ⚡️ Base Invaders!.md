> Base Invaders! can be defined as a strategic game with a focus on action. It belongs to the mainstream of production known as "tower defense", where you must protect our base against successive waves of enemies, and this by continually improving it. The authors have prepared many types of weapons (bombs, hammers, windmills, springs, lasers, various types of fireworks, flying machines), with which we fight with hordes of oncoming, often weird creatures. Each of them has different destructive properties and resistance to specific forms of attack. From the system to the system are placed before the player newer and more difficult challenges, which to cope with will need to heavily strain the gray cells ;-).
