Although Balabolka offers a lot of useful functions, we can simply launch the program, paste the text and press "play" so that the application starts reading the indicated fragment. Among the file formats that Balabolka supports, we can find: AZW, AZW3, CHM, DjVu, DOC, DOCX, EML, EPUB, FB2, FB3, HTML, LIT, MOBI, ODP, ODS, ODT, PDB, PDF, PPT, PPTX, PRC, RTF, TCR, WPD, XLS and XLSX.
 
 Balabolka uses any speech synthesizer installed on the user's computer. It is worth mentioning that the application allows you to change the font and color of the text, and also allows you to direct the process of reading from the system tray or using keyboard shortcuts. The authors also implemented a spell check function.
 
 Fragments of text pasted into the main Balabolek program window can be saved as audio files, saving them in WAV, MP3, MP4, OGG and WMA formats. If the text file is too big, then we can divide it into several smaller ones using. Additionally, the possibility of saving the text read by the synthesizer has been made available.
