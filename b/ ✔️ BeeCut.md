Installation using the timeline
 
 The described program for editing and creating films does not differ significantly from other solutions of this type, being at the same time an ideal tool for amateur applications in the privacy of the home. BeeCut support is carried out through a multi-track timeline, where the user places and assembles previously loaded audio and video materials, enriches them with effects, transitions, subtitles and soundtracks. Most of these activities will be done using the mouse and the drag-and-drop method.
 
 Image correction and effects
 
 BeeCut successfully supports video clips recorded using mobile devices (smartphones, tablets) as well as cameras and DSLR cameras. All the most popular multimedia formats with different aspect ratios (6: 9, 4: 3, 1: 1, 9:16 and 3: 4) are supported. The application offers a set of tools to correct the basic attributes of the image, allows you to create materials using the PiP effect (image in the image), and also supports masks that allow editing only selected areas of the image.
 
 BeeCut software has been made available for computers with Windows and Mac OS, as well as mobile devices with Android and iOS.
