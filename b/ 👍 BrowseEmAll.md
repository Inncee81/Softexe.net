Anyone who has been involved in the creation of websites for some time knows that one of the biggest mistakes of the webmaster is the need to make sure that the created project displays on each of the most important internet browsers on the market. Things get even more complicated turnaround on projects created also for mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones. Before the page lands on a publicly accessible server, you need to make sure that everything looks and works on every browser, no errors or poorly rescaled photos or tables appear on the page.
 
 BrowseEmAll facilitates compatibility tests, offering up to four panels in one window, in which you can load a given page using different browsers for that engine. The list includes all major programs of this type (Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera etc.), including some of their older versions. The application allows you to preview the page also on mobile browsers, set your own resolutions and display the code of individual elements and compile reports containing, among other things, about possible problems found in the code.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 14 days.
