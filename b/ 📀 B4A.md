The tool uses its own programming language, B4A, which is very easy to use, so knowledge of Visual Basic, VB6, VB.Net or any other programming languages ​​is not necessary. In addition to the coding option, there is also an option to create using the WYSIWYG editor.
 
 It should be noted that B4A offers two modes of operation. In local mode work takes place faster, and the user can take advantage of more functions (emulator support, USB debugging, etc.), while in remote mode, which can only be run in the trial version, the start of individual operations is greatly simplified.
 
 B4A is available as a standard version (includes free updates for two months) and Enterprise (two years of free upgrades). The test edition allows you to use the program for 30 days - the size of the created project is the limitation.
 
 It is worth noting that the complete documentation of the tool is available on the official website of the B4A manufacturer, as well as a detailed guide for beginners. We can also find there various tutorials to help you get started on your dream Android version.
