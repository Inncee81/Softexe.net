Before downloading the Book Collector application, however, you must bear in mind that it is only available in the English language version. This means that when you add a new book to our collection you have to enter its English-language title. The tool will automatically download all the necessary information about the book (author, title, publisher, genre, cover, dimensions, number of pages, etc.), as a result of which we will quickly enter the necessary data to the database of the described program.
 
 Book Collector can be installed on several PCs, and then synchronize the data entered between computers. The manufacturer also proposes to use the synchronization function via CLZ Cloud (no fees are charged).
 
 Attention!
 The trial version allows you to enter 100 books into your collection.
