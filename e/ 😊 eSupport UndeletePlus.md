The program is characterized by small size and uncomplicated service. It can be successfully used by novice users to recover data when competitive solutions fail. According to the developers, eSupport UndeletePlus can restore data from formatted volumes on which, for example, an operating system has already been installed.
 
 The entire data recovery process using eSupport UndeletePlus is limited to just two simple steps. The first one analyzes the content of the indicated medium (hard disk, external data store, USB storage device or memory card), as a result of which the list of recoverable data is displayed. Then the user indicates the files to be recovered, indicates the location in which they will be saved and clicks 'Recover File'.
 
 eSupport UndeletePlus supports IDE / ATA / SCSI hard drives, supporting FAT16, FAT32 and NTFS file systems.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to search for lost files, but it can not be recovered.
