Envisioneer allows, among others, to prepare a house design with walls, ceilings, stairs, windows, doors and floors. The interior can be equipped with objects from the library of programs and used to decorate available materials. In the library there are also models and textures needed to prepare the project of the nearest surroundings of the designed building. Resources can also be imported in the form of models whose drawing representations will be automatically generated.
 
 
 When designing specific rooms, such as bathrooms and kitchens, as well as farm buildings. The wizard allows you to choose the basic layout of the room, which you can then customize. 
 
 
 The prepared design can be viewed in three dimensions, show cross-sections and save the rendered images. Models can also be saved in the SketchUpa format. In other design templates you can prepare steel and wooden skeletons as well as a log house. The program also allows you to prepare an electrical installation project 
 
 
 The trial version of the program works for 30 days, allows you to save projects and has no functional limitations.
