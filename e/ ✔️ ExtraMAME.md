The described tool is nothing more than a graphic overlay (so-called GUI) for another popular emulator of old consoles such as MAME. Unlike the original, ExtraMAME is much easier to use, does not require complicated configuration and offers a set of 11 pre-installed games right after installation. However, this is not all, the app supports over 11,000. items that you can easily search from the level of the appropriate tab.
 
 The configuration options available within ExtraMAME allow you to turn off the sound in games, run games in windows, turn on the mouse and joystick in the game window, etc.
