Epic Games Launcher is a special application for customers of the Epic Games Store, thanks to which we can buy various digital games and accessories.

After launching the Epic Games Launcher and logging into your account (you can use, for example, a Google profile), we get access to the Epic Games Store main page, where you will find information on current premier, promotional offers or updates to already released games. We can also use the store, go to your own library or manage your friends list. The additional Unreal Engine tab allows you to install the Epic Games proprietary technology.
 
 Epic Games Launcher is an indispensable program, because only by using it we will download games available in Epic Games Store, and next we will download the latest versions of owned titles. 
 
 It is also worth bearing in mind that currently more and more publishers are giving up the distribution of their games via Steam, publishing them at the Epic Games Store. In addition, we regularly get the opportunity to download free games in the store (in the past, items such as Subnautica, Super Meat Boy and Axiom Verge were made available free of charge).
