The authors of the eDrawings program focused on minimalism, but it is thanks to it that the application is very easy to use and has a simple user interface. Apart from being able to read the content of a given file, the basic tools for editing projects are also included. We can change the size of individual objects, rotate them, move them, measure distances and angles, and more.
 
 eDrawings also includes additional settings that allow you to customize the appearance of the program to your preferences, changing the color of the highlight, the background color, the color of the paper, including or excluding shadows, and decide whether we prefer the tool to work as soon as possible or present everything in the highest possible quality.
