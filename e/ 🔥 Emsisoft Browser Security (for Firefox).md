The tool protects the user from launching suspicious web sites (eg those that spread malicious software), and thwarts attempts at phishing attacks. Emsisoft Browser Security was designed so that these options would work without monitoring user activity.
 
 Emsisoft Browser Security appears in the upper right corner of the screen. With one click of the mouse you can enable or disable the operation of this add-on. The authors also provided the possibility of reporting potentially harmful websites.
