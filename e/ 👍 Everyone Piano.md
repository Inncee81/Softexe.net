Everyone Piano is a computer software aimed at people who dream about learning to play the piano. At the same time, it has been prepared for users who can not afford to buy a real instrument.

Although at first glance it may seem that Everyone Piano is not - contrary to what the name suggests - an application for everyone, it is enough to notice that it is characterized by a really clear and easy-to-use interface. It is extremely important that the program can be used immediately after commissioning. The manufacturer made sure that the user does not have to (although he can) configure individual options, immediately joining the action.
 
 It is worth noting that in addition to the default function that allows you to play using the keyboard buttons, Everyone Piano also allows you to connect an external device communicating with the computer via the MIDI interface. 
 
 Everyone Piano allows you to download sounds from the VSTi database and offers access to several modes of operation: for children, adults and the elderly.
