The graphical interface of the application does not differ significantly from the solutions used by the competition. We find in it a well-thought-out division and arrangement of individual elements, the mechanism of independent cards, enabling work with many files simultaneously, and most importantly, most of them can be freely adapted to your preferences.
 
 The program offers such useful functions and tools as line numbering, code syntax coloring, screen ruler, but also support for many popular coding systems (including Unicode), multiple-selection mechanism (all you need to do is highlight a given phrase, and we can modify all of it instances), support for Emmet and Markdown mode, and built-in binary / hexadecimal editor.
 
 Other features that this small code editor has been equipped with include regular expression support, creating custom graphic styles, drag-and-drop support, recording and then macro playback, as well as a color capture tool. There were also support for large files or keyboard shortcuts, which improve work with the application.
