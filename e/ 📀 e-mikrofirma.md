Although the program is not extensive, it offers a set of features that should certainly satisfy the owners of companies from the micro sector. It enables convenient issuing of invoices, recording purchases, creating cash reports, as well as previewing lists of sales invoices, costs and fiscal cash registers. e-microfirma allows you to create a database of contractors and, what is important, from the level of application we prepare and then send to the Ministry of Finance the so-called Uniform Control File (JPK).
 
 The e-microfirma application is currently only available in the Windows version. According to the assurances of the Ministry of Finance, editions for the remaining platforms are to be made available over time.
