Epic Privacy Browser is another implementation of the browser on the Chromium platform, which is focused on protecting the privacy of the user on the Internet. Almost all functions and tools with which you can track user actions are removed from this web browser: plugins are not supported, visiting history and passwords are not saved, cookies are blocked, the cache is automatically cleared, there is no address bar prompt, the autotranslate is deactivated, and much more.

Of the available options, it is worth highlighting the Do Not Track tool, which blocks web analytics, ad networks, social network requests and other elements that track your activity until a certain key is pressed.

What else is interesting is the built-in proxy server. This feature is activated in manual mode, changing the user's location for all search engines in New Jersey (USA). This prevents the search engines from matching the user's requests with their real IP address.

Key features:


Do Not Track tracking lock function
forward proxy server for IP address spoofing
Safe search
delete all statistics and history when closing the browser
disabled plugin support, etc.
