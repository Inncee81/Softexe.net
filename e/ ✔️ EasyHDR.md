It allows you to easily combine images of one object with different exposure time settings into an image with an extended tonal range. The program supports files in JPEG and RAW formats, allowing HDR to be generated from both individual photographs and entire series. However, one should take into account that to achieve an interesting effect, one photo is not enough. It is best to work with three photos of the same frame, which were made using a tripod and different EV exposure values ​​(Exposure Value).
 
 EasyHDR when creating an HDR image first deals with proper framing, and then performs the tone mapping process. In both of these processes the program pre-uses standard settings, later giving the user the option of manual modification and correction.Attention!
 The trial version offers full functionality of the program. The only limitation is the imposition of watermarks on the created image in the form of the EasyHDR logo.
 
 There is also a free edition of EasyHDR Lite , which, compared to the version available here, offers only the function of linking images through masking mode.
