> EF Duplicate MP3 Finder is a program to search for duplicate audio files. More precisely: the same music files, so we can find unnecessary "clones" and delete them, thus regaining the same free space on the disk.

Application support is very simple, even in the absence of the Polish language version. At the very beginning, the user can set a preset, a set (later easily editable) of information on the basis of which the program will look for duplicates. You can search for a lot of folders and search filters, such as comparing album names, genres, BPM, etc. People looking for more advanced options will not be disappointed to see, among others, the ability to check files after modification date, selected attributes, and even length.
 
 Despite the name, EF Duplicate MP3 Finder allows you to search music files in formats not only MP3, but also OGG, WMA and FLAC by default. With the help of plugins (plugins) the number of supported formats increases drastically, enriching among others with MP4, WV, XM, APE, CDA and many more. As practically every other application from this manufacturer, also this allows for a fairly wide dose of personalization, among other things, the displayed font and colors.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
