Working with the program is based on built-in wizards that guide the user through the process of performing / restoring backup at each stage. The features offered allow you to create full backups, as well as to archive only the files modified since the previous backup. Eassos System Restore allows you to restore system status from previously created backups in several ways. The data contained in the backup will be restored from the level of the running Windows system, as well as using the bootable USB disk created optionally from the level of the tool.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 15 days.
