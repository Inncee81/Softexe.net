EasyBCD is a small tool that allows you to manage the loading of multiple operating systems installed on your computer. This download manager supports Windows, Linux / BSD, Mac OS X and NeoGrub.

If you like to experiment with new OSes without “demolishing” the current OS, then this is exactly the tool you need. Having installed several systems on your machine, the latest one will be loaded by default. In this case, switching to other "axes" through the boot-menu is very inconvenient, especially if you are dealing with two completely different operating systems (for example, Windows and Mac OS X). Significantly simplify the task of selecting the desired OS just help this program.

This utility allows adding and deleting OSes in one concise window, determining priorities for downloading, setting delay times for manual system selection, creating external bootable media, archiving and restoring BCD, rewriting MBR and much more.

In addition, there is a list of additional tools for working with the system:


iReboot - fast reboot to the desired OS,
command line,
EasyRE is a utility for repairing and restoring a PC if it stops booting,
Easy USB Creator - create bootable flash drives,
Windows license key identifier
quick access to the control panel.


It should be noted that there are no restrictions on the number of different operating systems - it all depends on your desire and the size of the disk space. In general, it can be stated that EasyBCD is really a convenient program for working with several operating systems on one PC at once.
