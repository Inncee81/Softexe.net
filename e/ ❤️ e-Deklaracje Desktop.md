e-declarations Desktop supports PIT-R, PIT-4R, PIT-6, PIT-6L, PIT-8AR, PIT-8C, PIT-11, PIT-11K, PIT-16, PIT-16A, PIT-16Z forms PIT-19A, PIT-28, PIT-36, PIT-36L, PIT-37, PIT-38, PIT-39, PIT-40 with attachments, as well as PCC-3 print and VAT-7 forms, VAT-7D and VAT-7K. The program allows creating many password protected user profiles, thanks to which your PITs on one computer can fill and store more people. The application works on the principle of active forms - automatically replenishing recurring content, calculated values, the target office can be selected from the list. The program is very easy to use and allows you to submit online declarations. The choice of a Public Benefit Organization for which the user wants to transfer 1% of the tax is facilitated by the link available to the OPP list.
 
 After sending the form, the program allows you to monitor its status (whether it has been accepted or rejected) and generates an Official Confirmation of Receipt for printing. In addition, the program has links to laws and regulations that help in filling out tax forms.
 
 Attention!
 To work with the program, an Adobe Reader document browser version 9.0 or newer is required.
