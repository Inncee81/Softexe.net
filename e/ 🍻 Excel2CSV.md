The application is very simple and does not require any specialist knowledge from the user. All we have to do is run the program and point to the file to be processed (the drag-and-drop method is supported), and Excel2CSV will instantly convert the data to a file compatible with Microsoft Excel and display a window with the choice of location to save the output file.
 
 Excel2CSV was created in Java language, and consequently the operation requires a JRE environment and is available for all the most popular platforms.
