The program allows you to recover lost or deleted data, files, folders, and even entire partitions from various types of hard disks (internal and external, FAT or NTFS format), floppy disks, memory cards etc. In comparison to the simpler version of Data Recovery, EasyRecovery Professional offers not only more advanced data recovery capabilities but above all the ability to repair damaged Microsoft Outlook (PST, OST), Outlook Express (DBX), Word (DOC), Excel (XLS), Access (MDB), PowerPoint (PPT) files, and also ZIP archives. It also includes an additional disk diagnostic tool.Attention!
 
 The trial version of the program has full functionality, but does not offer the possibility of file recovery (you can only see them).
 Under no circumstances can the program be installed on the disk partition from which the data has been deleted! In this case, the software must be installed and running on the second partition (if it exists) or an independent disk drive.
