EasyRecovery Home allows you to recover lost or deleted data, files, folders and even entire partitions from various types of hard drives (internal and external, FAT or NTFS format), floppy disks, memory cards, etc. The program also allows you to repair damaged ZIP archive files.
 
 A helpful feature of EasyRecovery is the ability to create a diskette from which you can start the computer to recover data if the data has been so deleted or damaged that it is impossible to launch the operating system.Attention!
 
 The trial version of the program has full functionality, but does not offer the possibility of file recovery (you can only see them).
 Under no circumstances can the program be installed on the disk partition from which the data has been deleted! In this case, the software must be installed and running on the second partition (if it exists) or an independent disk drive.
