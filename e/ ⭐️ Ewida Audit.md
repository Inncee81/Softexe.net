The Ewida Audit app can function as an independent product for the audit and monitoring of employees, as well as in conjunction with the Ewida Standard record system as a comprehensive IT system in the company. The audit process in Codenica Audit is divided into two parts: scanning and recognition. The first part is responsible for downloading the source information (WMI, Windows Registry, scanned files) from the audited computers. The second is the process of converting source objects into recordable objects (computer sets, devices and software). Each of these stages can be configured in detail by the User.	 
 
 Each object recognized in the audit (a computer set, device, software) has its history since its creation and records all changes made. Objects can be connected relativly to others, creating OEM, CAL or affiliation relationships. The program enables performing single or periodic audits (computer audit, software legality audit). The completed audit can be finished with a printout of relevant statements and reports from the program, or exported to the Ewida Standard IT system and processed there.
 
 The second important function of the Codenica Audit program is the monitoring of computers and employees in the network. It requires installing employees on the employees' computers. Agents, i.e. small modules that monitor current computer work and employee activity. Agent allows, among others to monitor activities such as turning on and off the computer, pressed keyboard and mouse keys, window foreground times and inactivity times, software and installed devices.
