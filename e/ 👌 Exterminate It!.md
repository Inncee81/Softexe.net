The application can and does not have a particularly attractive appearance and in this respect certainly loses with many modern antiviruses, but the program's interface is simply readable and easy to use. We can scan the computer using one of four modes: Smart Scan (the fastest option, checks the contents of memory and the most frequently used by viruses in the file system), Full Scan (full scan, taking the most time, but also the most accurate), Custom Scan (manual scan indication of directories and files to be checked) and Memory Scan (checking the operating memory, useful in order to eliminate already launched pests).
 
 Exterminate It! it allows to protect the user against the threats of basically the majority of unwanted and malicious software such as viruses, Trojans, dialers, spyware, malware, adware, rootkits, etc. The database of known threats is updated daily, and some novelty is the lack of major contraindications in order to use this program as an additional security along with another anti-virus system.
 
 Attention!
 
 The demo version of the application allows you to make a system scan, but prevents the removal of detected threats.
 It is possible to register a trial version, which allows you to get full program functionality for a week.
