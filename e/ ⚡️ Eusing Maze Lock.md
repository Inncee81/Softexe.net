Eusing Maze Lock is a small and very easy to use tool that allows you to block access to your computer during your absence. It works on a similar basis to the screen unlocking mechanism on Android smartphones and tablets, allowing access to the computer only after drawing a predefined shape.

The program is ideal for people who often leave their workplace during their daily work with computers and do not want others to search in their private documents, photos, etc. during their absence. With the help of Eusing Maze Lock, we can conveniently secure access to a computer against unauthorized people, and an unsuccessful attempt to "log in" will block the possibility of retrying for 60 seconds and an alarm beep will sound.
 
 The blocking process itself may be limited to clicking the tool's icon in the system tray. This process can also be initiated via a keyboard shortcut or completely automatically when the user is inactive. Unlocking access to the system is possible only after "drawing" using the previously defined shapes displayed on the screen. Optionally, each of them can be marked by a letter, then it is enough in the appropriate field to enter their sequence corresponding to the mentioned shape.
