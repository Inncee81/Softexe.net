After launching Express Zip, you can choose whether you want to open your ZIP archive or create a completely new one. If we decide on the second option, we will only have to add selected files that will automatically go to the MyZip archive located in the Windows Operating System documents (both the archive name and the save path can of course be changed).
 
 Express Zip also offers the possibility of performing other operations on ZIP files. We can divide them into several smaller parts, protect them with a password and then send them via e-mail. There was no option to convert archives to popular formats (the application supports RAR, CAB, TAR, 7z, ISO, GZIP, ZIPX, LZH, ARJ and more).
 
 It is worth mentioning that Express Zip has been equipped with the function of recording archived files to a DVD or CD. With this option, we will back up important data that will be stored on external media.
