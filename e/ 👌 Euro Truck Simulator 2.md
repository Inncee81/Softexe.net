Although the life of the Tira driver is widely regarded as not very interesting, so many would have dreamed about such a job and visiting the world on board a multi-wheeled machine. Euro Truck Simulator 2 allows you to fulfill your dreams without leaving your home or spending money on very expensive transport vehicles. By starting the game on the computer, you can start a great journey on European roads and cities.

The virtual driver can choose from many actually existing brands of Tirs, and additionally adapt the cars to themselves. This includes not only purely cosmetic changes, i.e. a different varnish or adding lights, but also the replacement of the engine, suspension, exhaust system, tires and even the entire cabin. Thus, it is possible to modify the car so that it looks like a player wants and leads as well as it is comfortable. In the end, he will spend hours on board.
 
 
 The amount of time spent on roads translates directly to the level of the driver, and hence, among other things, the number of missions available for him to perform in various parts of the world. Professional development is important for acquiring new clients, who will, of course, also pay tensometers more adequately. From the poor performance of each task with someone else's car, you go to a self-confident and cash-rich administrator of your entire fleet.
 
 
 
 Euro Truck Simulator 2 offers additional packages with different parts of Europe, so you can not only visit more or less faithfully reconstructed roads and metropolises from Germany, France or Italy, but also, among others, Great Britain and Poland. Separately, there are also packages with parts for Tir modification or other types of transport orders. Fans of simulators of all sorts should have a great time here.
