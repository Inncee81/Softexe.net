The program in its offer has over 200 usable logos, 2,000 symbols, cliparts and gradients. Each of them can be freely modified by the user, and changes can be subjected to, among others, size of graphics, graphic effects applied on it, background and many other aspects of the created project. In addition to our work, we can import and use any graphics in GIF, BMP, JPG, PCX, PNG, TIFF, TGA, PSD, ICO, CUR, ANI, WMF and EMF formats.
 
 EximiousSoft Logo Designer is a perfect solution for people who do not necessarily have the right knowledge to create an effective logo or do not want to spend money on expensive graphics packages. The tool, apart from the possibility of using ready-made projects, also allows you to create your own logos from scratch.
 
 The logotype prepared in the program can be saved to the ELD file, which gives the possibility of its subsequent modification. In addition, it is also possible to export graphics to JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP, PCX, TIFF and TGA formats.Attention!
 
 The test version of the program applies a watermark to it when saving the finished project.
