Using the EVGA Precision X program, we can easily increase the clock speed and voltage of the GPU processor, clock memory and freely control the speed of rotation in the mounted fan. In this way, you can quickly and accurately overclock the graphics card, thereby increasing its performance.  
 
 
 The program is also used to monitor the work of the entire graphic layout. It displays the temperature of the graphics processor and provides the exact fan speed. In addition, it has integrated modules that allow you to adjust the voltage and display GPU temperature in the system tray. It is also worth mentioning an additional service that allows you to take screenshots of running games.
 
 
 Particularly noteworthy is the built-in Fan Curve option, with which we can easily control the work of the mounted fan. EVGA Precision X also displays the most important information about the mounted graphics card, giving the full name of the model and manufacturer, the version of the drivers and the BIOS. In addition, its resources could not be missing a special OSD module for displaying GPU temperature, clock timing and frame rate (FPS) during playing. 
 Attention!
 The EVGA Precision X program has only been partially polonized. All configuration options and some texts in the main application screen have been translated.
