The program emphasizes the ease of use and the lowest possible number of settings and notifications, assuming that the majority of users expect from this type of tool primarily unnoticeable work in the background.
 
 The whole creates a tool that protects the user against a wide range of threats. The ThreatSense technology, known to the ESET NOD32 users, has been developed with artificial intelligence components, significantly improving the possibilities of the program's self-detection of new threats. Users familiar with the NOD32 program will also appreciate the speed of the new package. ESET Internet Security should not affect the performance of your computer.
 
 New in the 2018 version is, among others, the license manager (which was already present in the products of ESET for companies), a home network scanner that analyzes the computer environment including devices on the Internet of Things and is able to perform a brute force test on router security and A UEFI scanner running in the background that protects you against threats running before the operating system.
 
 
 Attention!
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
