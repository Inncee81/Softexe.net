The application gives you the opportunity to remove various types of shortcomings in digital photographs that were created by shooting in bad light or with the wrong settings of the camera. With Easy Photo Unblur, you can easily sharpen the image or remove blur caused by the movement of the subject or camera shake when taking a picture.
 
 Easy Photo Unblur is based on advanced artificial intelligence algorithms that analyze the image, and then allow correction only of blurred areas, not the entire photo as it is in most cases. Blur reduction can be done in one of the available intensity modes with the option of defining a smoothing radius and the amount of detail.
 
 The program also includes a set of basic tools for image correction - brightness, contrast, saturation, color temperature, shade and gamma. An auto-correction option is available.
 
 Easy Photo Unblur allows you to process individual photos as well as their entire sets in batch mode. Most of the most popular graphic formats are supported - e.g. JPG, BMP, GIF, PNG, ICO, TIF, TGA, PSD, PCX and WMF.
