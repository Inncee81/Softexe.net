The software bases its operation on the same virus signature databases as the popular ESET Smart Security and NOD32 Antivirus, without requiring installation. It provides effective protection of the Windows operating system against all kinds of pests, whose task is, among others, stealing confidential data or displaying persistent ads. Operation of ESET Online Scanner is fully automated - after launching a deep system scan and the most vulnerable locations are carried out.
 
 ESET Online Scanner checks applications run in parallel with the system (the so-called autostart), scans the boot disk sectors and thus detects threats that are launched before the system starts, scans files in the system registry, and cures infections in which to effectively removal of the threat requires restarting the system and detects potentially dangerous and undesirable applications.
 
 It is worth noting that in spite of such large possibilities ESET Online Scanner should not be used as a replacement for a standard antivirus program. It is the perfect complement to such security software.
