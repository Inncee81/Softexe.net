Eye Saver is a program to protect the eyesight of the user during everyday work on the computer.

The default filter in Eye Saver is health, which activates immediately after starting the described tool. However, we can use other modes such as: movie, hacker or reading (in the case of the last one there are two variants to choose from) to adapt the application to your own preferences. Among the options you will also find the ability to change the brightness of the image and the level of intensity of the blue filter.
 
 Eye Saver does not require any work using these overlays, but they can be activated at specific intervals to allow the user to take a short break according to a predefined schedule.
