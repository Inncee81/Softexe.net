Exposure is one of the best photo styling programs using effects that simulate the real clichés and imperfections of well-known lenses. In addition, the program works well when converting RAW files from digital cameras, enhancing the color of photos and basic retouching. You can also use it as a graphical file browser, with the ability to mark photos, evaluate, filter and search.

In this program, you can give your photos a unique character and play on emotions using effects that imitate Kodak, Ilford or Polaroid cultic clichés. The collection includes several hundred of them, from very old black and white, through film strips to quite new ones, both black and white and colorful. There were plenty of infrared sensitive films.
 
 
 After selecting your favorite film, you can adjust various image parameters such as exposure, lighting, color saturation, frame or sharpness. You can also reach for curves and finally generate grain, vignette and bokeh effect. The program is complemented by textures and frames that can be placed on the photo. They may imitate old paper, scratches or leaky light leaking through a leaky cartridge. The effects are presented live and the settings can be saved for reuse.
 
 
 Exposure is able to open RAW files from multiple cameras, but it does not handle such a wide collection as programs designed to trigger RAW files. 
 
 
 The program can be tested for 30 days without restrictions. The effects are saved in the TIFF format, which can be further processed. Together with Exposure X2, you can test the Snap Art program sold separately .
