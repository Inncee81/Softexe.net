The action is set for thousands of years in the future, when after the depletion of natural resources on Earth began, mankind went en masse to conquer the stars. She discovered a completely new galaxy from which, as a result of the unfortunate consequences of fate, she could not return later. That is how the colonization of the so-called New Eden began by the survivors divided into several major factions. The player decides to belong to one of them, but first create a character, choosing one of the available races and refining the look of your pilot. It will be an alter ego of the user.
 
 
 The fun is to fly around the universe and discover new places, and at the same time also trade. Everything happens in the universe constantly developed by the creators, with thousands of solar systems and randomly generated places in space. This vastness of space is managed by a carefully designed team of law enforcement officers, but also ongoing scuffles between the largest federations, fighting for influence, and gathering many players and substantial fleets, ready to hit the potential enemy. Occasionally, there are accidental wars.
 
 
 They are wreaking havoc, because behind every destroyed ship or other unit, there are hours of gameplay at its acquisition, and money is simply in the world. Although MMO is paid, the smarter players will be able to constantly finance the time of fun with virtual currency, gained in EVE Online. You just have to be enterprising and fall in love with this product. Understanding the complex systems that govern the game will help well-done tutorials, and there will be also friendly players who are eager to introduce newcomers to the meanders of play.
