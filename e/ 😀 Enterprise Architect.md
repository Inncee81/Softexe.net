> Enterprise Architect is a powerful environment for analyzing and designing software using UML. It supports the programmer at almost every stage of software development - from designing, creating documentation and implementation.

The tool finds its applications in the work of programmers (as well as entire groups of them) who deal with the production of complex and extensive software. It improves the creation of various types of diagrams, presenting many aspects of the designed software, generating documentation and code skeleton on the basis of diagrams modeled in UML. Enterprise Architect brings together a set of useful tools that allow for team work of programmers, reporting, support for frameworks, repositories, as well as database modeling, etc.
 
 Among the supported modeling standards we find, among others UML 2.4, BPMN 2.0, SysML 1.2 and BPEL 2.0. The environment also enables the creation of extensive mind maps. Enterprise Architect offers features for requirements management (extremely important in the initial stages of project work), documentation generator in RTF, PDF and HTML formats, transformation of selected models, etc. Additionally, extended functionality can be implemented by the programmer through UML profiles, editable templates, as well as scripts allowing, for example, the automation of specific operations.
 
 Enterprise Architect also allows generation of source code in ActionScript, C, C #, C ++, Delphi, Java, PHP, Python, Visual Basic 6 and Visual Basic .NET languages, while ensuring synchronization of the code with the model and vice versa. The software can be used in reverse engineering, ie generating models based on source code.
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
