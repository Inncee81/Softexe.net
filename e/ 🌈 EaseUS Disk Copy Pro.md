EaseUS Disk Copy Pro does not require any special knowledge on the part of the user, because the entire operation is performed in three simple steps (choose the source disk, target disk and click the button). With this application, we can create a copy of the selected HDD, and then place it on another computer, so that it contains exactly the same data, settings or applications, not to mention about the whole operating system.
 
 However, this is not all, because EaseUS Disk Copy Pro also offers the option of creating a boot disk. We can burn it to a CD or DVD, and even put in the memory of a mobile device connected to the USB port. The program supports all operating systems, file systems and partition types.
 
 EaseUS Disk Copy Pro can be a useful tool, which is worth using to replace HDD with a new one with a larger capacity or if, for example, you intend to move the operating system to an SSD drive to make the computer run faster, and we do not want to reinstall Windows.
