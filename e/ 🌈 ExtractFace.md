ExtractFace is a tool addressed to Facebook users enabling the extraction of data placed on this social network.
```
[![ExtractFace](https://gallery.dpcdn.pl/imgc/Tools/82017/g_-_420x350_1.5_-_x649603d0-5eb5-45bf-a7ed-9ba509f667ff.png)](https://softexe.net/win/system/other/extractface:pRcec.html)

If we would like to download from Facebok all the materials that we have made available, including, for example, photos or videos, it would require a lot of dedication from us. We would have to download each file manually, spending a lot of time on performing repetitive activities, which we can save by using the ExtractFace program.
 
 ExtractFace allows you to download Facebook data to your computer's hard drive to a specific directory that we can previously name, so that you do not have to manually organize your files later. The application offers many configuration options that allow you to even define the size of the downloaded photo.
 
 Attention!
 
 ExtractFace is required to install Firefox in Extended Support Release (the application does not work with the standard edition of the browser) along with the MozRepl plugin.
