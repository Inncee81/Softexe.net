After importing the form using the API key, the EFT account allows you to arrange sets of modules for different ships and different characters. The application allows, of course, to view already known skills and certificates of each of the imported characters. 
 
 
 The right ship can be selected from a simple browser, and the equipment is selected from a large database, where it has been sorted by category, type and size, if needed. The program will inform you if the character does not have the skills needed to drive the ship or use the modules. When arranging the equipment, the program automatically calculates the ship's statistics, such as available computing power and power, the rate of discharging the battery, firepower, defensive capabilities, speed and the like. If necessary, you can add bonuses from other fleet members.
 
 
 The program allows you to view information on each of the available ships and modules. 
 
 
 The approximate price of the set is also calculated on an ongoing basis.
