Easy 7-Zip is a free data compression program, which was created on the basis of the popular 7-Zip (version 15.06). It offers the full functionality of its protoplast, and additionally introduces a number of minor changes and modifications, aimed at improving the comfort of working with the tool.

The program does not make any changes to the compression engine itself. It still has a high compression ratio of 7z. The creator, James Hoo, focused instead on modifying the options available from the context menu. Icons appeared in it, and individual functions were sorted. Among the changes from the original 7-Zip, we also find the possibility of minimizing the progress window during the decompression of files and the options of displaying the contents of the target folder and deleting the archives after unpacking the files in them.
 
 Easy 7-Zip supports archives in the following formats: 7z, ARJ, BZIP2, CAB, CHM, CPIO, CramFS, DEB, DMG, FAT, GZIP, HFS, ISO, LZH, LZMA, MBR, MSI, NSIS, NTFS, RAR, RPM, SquashFS, TAR, UDF, VHD, WIM, XAR, XZ, Z and ZIP. In addition to the possibility of basic compression / decompression of data, the program also allows you to compare and generate MD5 checksums, secure archives with the AES-256 algorithm and create self-extracting SFX archives.
