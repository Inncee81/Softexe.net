The program automatically ensures that the user sees different graphics each time. Their history is also recorded, making it easy to get to the photos we saw earlier, and for some reason we would like to look at them again. We can get to the history from the level of the preview from the bottom edge of the screen.
 
 This extension is integrated with the Google Earth web application, so that each displayed image is described in the lower right corner and it is possible to move to the application to display the part of the Earth from which the given photograph originated.
