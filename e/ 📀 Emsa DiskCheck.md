The described application can be used in a variety of situations. For example, when the CD or DVD we have was scratched and we are not sure if it is still usable. Emsa Disk Check checks all the contents of the indicated medium, and if it finds any errors, it provides detailed information about them; the program also tests the speed of the given drive.
 
 It is also worth mentioning several other Emsa Disk Check options. The program scans and reads the disk at the maximum available speed until the operation is completed (it can take up to several hours) or the user stops it. The application also presents a list of files blocked by the Windows operating system and generates reports on the progress and the aforementioned errors.
 
 Among the data carriers supported by Ems Disk Check we can find: CD, DVD, CD-R / RW DVD-R / RW, HDD, SSD, SSHD, USB memory, SD cards and even floppy disks.
