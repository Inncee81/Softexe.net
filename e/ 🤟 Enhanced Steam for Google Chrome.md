To realize the potential of Enhanced Steam, just go to the extension settings. In the shop category, we can, according to many criteria, set the marking of subsequent productions with the color of your choice: for example those that are already on the wish list or those with temporary keys.
 
 Even more useful are, however, the functions available in the menu Price: you can activate the history of price changes, but above all, combine them with offers from other platforms, also including rebate codes. In addition, you can order here to filter items from the list due to the location criterion.
 
 Enhanced Steam not only gives you the opportunity to get a better idea of ​​the offer on Steam, but also save money in an easy-to-use way that makes the Steam platform simply more readable and advanced.
