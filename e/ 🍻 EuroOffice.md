The software includes such applications as the EuroOffice Writer text editor, the EuroOffice Calc spreadsheet, the EuroOffice Impress presentation tool, the EuroOffice Draw drawing and editing program, and the EuroOffice Base database management. It is available in 7 languages ​​(including Polish) and supports files created using Microsoft Office. EuroOffice also allows you to save data in your own formats, compatible with the open ISO Standard OpenDocument Format.
 
 EuroOffice, unlike its protoplast, was equipped with a set of functions and patches that were never introduced in OpenOffice. Beginning with the 2008 version, the EuroOffice software is built on the basis of the improved code of the above-mentioned prototype, which is being developed as part of a research and development project by MultiRáció and the scientific unit of Szeged University.
 
 The package has support for extensions, most of which, according to the creators' assurances, is also compatible with Apache OpenOffice and LibreOffice.
