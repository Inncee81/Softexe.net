The operating principle of Emby Server is very simple. After logging in to the user account, the tool automatically converts and streams the image "on the fly" to the selected device, so regardless of the file format, we can view your movie on your computer, laptop, tablet or any other portable device or play music or any multimedia file.
 
 Built-in, easy to use web-based tools offer easy multimedia management (editing, search, etc.). Additionally, thanks to Emby Server, you can easily control access to content after sharing the library with younger users (eg children), among others by using the remote application service function.
 
 Emby Server allows you to synchronize user's multimedia using "cloud" data saving for backup, data archiving and conversion. Noteworthy is also mobile synchronization. In this case, we are dealing with media synchronization between all devices, which allows easy playback of files in offline mode.
