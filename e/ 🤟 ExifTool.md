It is very important that inexperienced users who intend to make use of the ExifTool program before starting any operations create a backup of their data. In the event of failure, they can overwrite damaged files at any time or restore lost video, music or sound files.
 
 ExifTool supports the most popular file formats, such as: FLAC, MP3, 3GP, GIF, MOV, PNG, TIFF, BMP, SWF, FLV, AVI, MPG and many more. The application offers the possibility of working on one file at the same time, and also includes the batch processing function, thanks to which we can save a lot of time in a situation where we have to perform a large number of operations.
