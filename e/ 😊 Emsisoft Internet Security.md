The Emsisoft Internet Security main window displays the status of all the most important components of the package. It is modeled on the Modern UI interface, allows you to perform a scan, informs about the number of files in quarantine, as well as recent reports. The package consists of several modules: an anti-virus equipped with a file scanner, an automatic firewall, protection while browsing websites, as well as control of application behaviors (eg protection against keyloggers). Although the firewall is intelligent and makes decisions automatically, the user can manually manage calls and add own rules. It is also possible to create entire rules regarding aggregate application restrictions, as well as sending email notifications when a virus is detected.
 
 The package offers scheduled, periodic scanning as well as notification management. It is possible to secure the settings with a password, or to limit them for each system user separately. Emsisoft Internet Security creates automatic reports related to the operation of its individual components, it also allows you to view files in quarantine and add secure data to the list of exclusions. The trial version allows you to use the package for 30 days without restrictions. After this time, you must purchase a license.
