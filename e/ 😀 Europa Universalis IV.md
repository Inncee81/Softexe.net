Players will play the ruler and will rule their country over 300 years, making many important decisions that will affect the further course of the game. Only from the choices made will depend on how we will perceive other governmenters, as well as society. Europa Universalis IV offers great freedom of action, providing virtually unlimited possibilities.
 
 Europa Universalis IV is extremely faithful to historical realities, thanks to which during the game we can not only demonstrate tactical sense, but also get acquainted with various facts about events that took place in the past. 
 
 People who have previously had contact with the Europa Universalis series will surely notice that in the "four" a lot of novelties have been implemented. A new trade system has appeared, and in addition, many additional diplomatic solutions have been made available (coalitions, threats, wars, incitement to revolution), thanks to which we have more room for maneuver in resolving conflicts.
 
 Europa Universalis IV offers both a story campaign and a multiplayer mode with the option of rivalry or cooperation.
