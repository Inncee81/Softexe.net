 The e-pity program does not limit your choice and allows you to enter the KRS number of the organization you want to transfer to 1% yourself. The program allows for convenient and safe delivery of all e-declarations, both those requiring qualified signatures, and those authorized using verification data without the need to use an e-signature. Before the shipment, it verifies the correctness of the entered data and allows you to follow the subsequent stages of communication with the servers of the Ministry of Finance, up to the automatic receipt of the Official Confirmation of Receipt (UPO), which can be obtained at the e-mail address provided.
 
 Attention!
 
 
 As the developers of the application point out, it is free for both private and commercial use, provided that 1% is transferred to any OPP.
