The tool seems to look the same as the traditional version of Google Chrome, but in fact the Enterprise version has a number of options not available in the standard edition of the application. People using this program can count on regular updates (they are automatically installed), so that they will always have the latest security patches. It is also important that such a solution guarantees administrators constant access to advanced technologies.
 
 Google Chrome Enterprise emphasizes the security of the person using this web browser. In addition to the HSTS protocol, the tool offers the possibility of using the network in private mode, thanks to which the computer is less susceptible to virus attacks (even phishing and malware).
