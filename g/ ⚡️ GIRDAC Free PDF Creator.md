GIRDAC Free PDF Creator works with over 300 different programs for Windows, allowing you to create PDFs, which we can then print. The tool allows you to convert Word files (DOC and DOCX), other text documents (RTF and TXT), as well as multimedia presentations (PowerPoint) to PDF.
 
 GIRDAC Free PDF Creator also offers the function of saving settings, thanks to which we do not have to configure the program every time, but we can use the previously prepared options. After converting the selected file to PDF, the tool displays a report showing the results of the mentioned operation.
