The program is characterized by a very simple to use and clear user interface. GOM Studio supports both the most popular streaming services, such as YouTube, Twitch, Facebook and dailymotion, as well as lesser-known services: Connect Game, INSTAGIB, Ustream, Azubu.TV and hitbox. 
 
 GOM Studio offers not only the possibility of streaming video, but also allows you to record user activities and save them to your hard disk. In the event of a possible failure of one of the aforementioned services, we will not lose our programs and we will be able to make them available to viewers again. 
 
 GOM Studio automatically detects connected devices (eg camera or microphone) and contains many configuration options. We can change the resolution of the image, the number of frames per second, determine the quality of the sound or define the program so that it interrupts the transmission after a specified time.
