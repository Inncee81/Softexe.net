Thanks to the use of transports offered in the Jabber network, Gajima users can easily communicate with users of networks such as Gadu-Gadu, Tlen, Yahoo, MSN, AIM or ICQ. Among the many features offered by Gajima we will find such as grouped conversations on the cards of one window, transfers of files to different networks, display of metacontacts in the main program window, support for emoticons, avatars, spelling checker and much more.
 
 A very useful option for this messenger is to support multiple accounts at the same time and the ability to view services and registration on Jabber servers.
