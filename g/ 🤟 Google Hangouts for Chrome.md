This messenger was created by Google as the successor of Google Talk and is an interesting alternative to the popular Skype. It is used for sending text messages to friends, conducting audio- and video-talks, including conferences, as well as telephoning through VoIP.
 
 Google Hangouts for Chrome is targeted to all Chrome users who have an active Google account. Importantly, the extension can act as a native application. This means that in order to use Hangouts, you do not need to have a browser running and the messenger is in a separate window.
