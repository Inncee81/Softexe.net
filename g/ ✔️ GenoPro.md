GenoPro is an extensive program for building graphic family trees in the form of genograms equipped with a mechanism for creating tabular reports and statistics about the family, available in the Polish language version.

We start work with GenoPro from a blank page, on which we can apply more people, and then combine them into pairs and add offspring. If we are not satisfied with manually adding people and relations between them, we can use the Family Assistant function, which will generate appropriate objects in the genogram immediately based on the data entered in the wizard.
 
 What distinguishes the program from many competing applications is the unbelievably large amount of data that can be described by individuals or relationships. For example, for each person we can note baptism dates, godparents or place of birth, and even the length of pregnancy or doctor receiving childbirth - the application offers dedicated fields, which can then be searched and on the basis of which reports are generated. Similarly, we will note the place and cause of death, and even the place of burial. The program also calculates the age of all people living and deceased on their own. Relationships also offer many options: ranging from marriages (divided into civil and denominational) by cohabiting to unions, from biological descendants to adopted and adopted children. These relationships can also be described in detail (dates of the ceremony, the reasons for the termination of the relationship). Multiple marriages of the same person, which resulted in several children are not a problem for GenoPro.
 
 After creating the tree and completing as much information as possible, we can use the GenoPro reporting part. In addition to generating a full tree in HTML in a form reminiscent of the Wiki, it is also possible to display selected data in the form of tables. Thanks to this, we can, for example, view all marriages and check if we have entered the correct dates of their conclusion. GenoPro also supports importing and exporting all data to the GEDCOM format, as well as exporting to XML, MetaFile or a text file.
 
 Free and trial version
 
 The GenoPro program can be downloaded free of charge. The unregistered version allows you to open all family trees and save those that consist of no more than 25 people. Free registration with the manufacturer allows you to receive a test key that removes the limit when you register for 15 days. To use the program longer and still be able to save large trees, it is necessary to purchase a license.
