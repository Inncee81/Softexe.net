> GOG Galaxy is a completely optional program for handling games purchased on the GOG.com digital platform. The tool allows you to perform operations such as buying, downloading and installing games, and then allows you to run them.

All games available on the GOG.com platform are unprotected, so you can run them offline (without internet access). In addition, there is nothing to prevent you from backing up the installation file and put it on any medium (such as a disc, external hard disk or memory card).  
 
 An interesting option offered by GOG Galaxy is the ability to restore the game to an earlier version after installing the update. Some patches can do more harm than good. Occasionally, when they are uploaded, a given production simply works much worse (animation loses liquidity, and some functionalities are no longer available). To prevent such troubles you can turn off automatic updates completely.
 
 The program includes a cross-play function, which allows joint game play in the same game to GOG.com and Steam publishers. The creators of GOG Galaxy also made sure that the player had access to online matchmaking, achievements and various statistics related to particular titles. There could also be no social options, such as chat and a list of friends that you can invite to play together.  
 
 GOG Galaxy is characterized by a transparent, very clear and ingenious user interface. All digital games that are on our account have been presented in the form of boxes placed on the shelves. Noteworthy is also the fact that the application also includes a search engine, which turns out to be very useful when we have a large number of games in your collection.
