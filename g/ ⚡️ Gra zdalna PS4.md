> Remote Game PS4 (PS4 Remote Play) is an application for computers with Windows and Mac OS operating systems, thanks to which we can launch the PlayStation 4 console in remote mode.

After running the tool on your computer, you need to follow the instructions on the screen and turn on the console at the right moment to pair it with our PC. From that moment on PC, using the described application, we will be able to perform the same activities as on PS4, i.e. play, browse friends lists, achievements or PlayStation Store content.
 
 The PS4 remote game will work in a situation where the TV, to which the console is connected, will be occupied by other household members. Then we can play our favorite games from PlayStation 4 on the computer, using the streaming function offered by this application. However, keep in mind that the picture quality is lower than when using PlayStation 4 on a TV via an HDMI cable.
 
 The program can locate the running PlayStation 4 console automatically. If such operation is too long for the user, it is also possible to manually search for the device. In the PS4 Remote Game program, enter the code shown on the TV screen to which the PlayStation 4 console is connected, going first to "settings", "remote game connection settings" and selecting the option "add device".
 
 Attention!
 
 To run the program, you must have a PlayStation 4 console, a computer with Internet access (at least 15 Mb / s), a USB cable or a wireless USB adapter for the DualShock 4 controller and a free Sony Entertainment Network account.
