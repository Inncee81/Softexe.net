Working with the application is based on a multimedia library created by the user, adding short videos, photos or soundtracks to it. The assembly uses a timeline that has several paths for individual multimedia that can be interlaced with each other. In the user's hand, there is also a set of tools that allows him to enrich his amateur production with many interesting elements.
 
 GOM Mix Pro has, among others, the option of adding subtitles and small graphics to the video, impressive templates with animations, various types of zooming and moving the frame, enriching materials with frames and various graphic motifs. There were also graphic filters to manipulate the basic attributes of the image and animations of transitions of photos and clips.
 
 The tool supports multimedia and graphics on the input in the most popular formats. The finished project can be exported to MP4, OGM or FLV files using a number of configuration options relating to to the quality of the original clip, resolution, used filters and AV codecs, etc. GOM Mix Pro also allows transfer of created material to YouTube, Google Drive and Facebook.
 
 Attention!
 The free version has a limitation, allowing only basic templates, animations, filters and effects to be used in the project.
