Thanks to Grand Theft Auto Online, we get the opportunity to create a unique hero who will take part in various tasks alongside real companions. The action takes place again in Los Santos and on the outskirts of the city, but this time we explore them, meeting characters directed by players from around the world. Interestingly, we are dealing here with fully fictionalized missions, and we get to know details about them by watching carefully made, sometimes quite extensive, cutscenes.
 
 Together with the other participants of the GTA Online game, we will attack banks, compete in racing competitions, perform everyday tasks, buy and tune cars, acquire various properties, adjust the appearance of your protagonist, and even create your own criminal organization. It is also possible to design your own missions using the available wizard.
 
 Grand Theft Auto Online debuted at the end of 2013. From that moment, dozens of additions have been released that introduce both the abovementioned possibilities and a number of other attractions. All extensions have been made available to Grand Theft Auto V owners for free, but the network component in question still contains embedded micropayments. For real money you can buy new types of weapons, items to change the appearance of the hero, modifications to vehicles and many, many more.
