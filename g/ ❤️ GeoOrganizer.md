The application allows you to conveniently collect databases of applications (centers), clients, landowners or contractors. It offers the possibility of addressing envelopes, maintaining a broadcasting book, using dictionaries of the type of submitted works, towns and streets, as well as creating documents based on templates shared by other users.
 
 Within the documentation of a selected geodetic survey GeoOrganizer gives the possibility to collect files in various formats - PDF, photos or scans. Additionally, knowing the territorial number of the work, the program can display the indicated area via Google maps. Importantly, the application did not lack costing and billing options, as well as a built-in schedule.
 
 GeoOrganizer can work as a standard, single-user program. Optionally, after starting the server with the database, it can be used in the company's local network.
 
 Attention!
 
 The manufacturer provides free access to the program updates for the first year after installation.
