The program may turn out to be extremely useful in situations when the operating system has already been infected by malware, but there is no obstacle to using it to prevent computer content from being preventive. It offers as many as 5 different scanning modes, capable of covering the entire system content, critical areas or user-defined areas, as well as removable media connected to the computer. GridinSoft Anti-Malware can also scan autostart, cache, services, ActiveX sections, as well as LSP and BHO positions. In many cases, the tool is able to detect and remove pests that are invisible to standard security software.
 
 In addition, GridinSoft Anti-Malware offers proactive protection, as well as useful functions for resetting Internet Explorer settings, clearing the HOSTS file and resetting the Windows Update configuration. Available configuration options allow the user to customize many attributes of the program's operation to their preferences - including ignoring large files (over 16 MB), archives, incomplete data, etc.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 15 days. With its use, it is not possible to remove the detected pests.
