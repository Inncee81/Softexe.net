Since its prototype, it differs from the user interface, which has been modified to remind the leader in the field that is Adobe Photoshop. This is to allow for easier "transfer" to current users of Photoshop for a free equivalent. Modifications mainly include the structure and naming of all options and tools in the program menu - they are (as far as possible) close to what you can find in Photoshop. The keyboard shortcuts are also similar. In addition, the method of starting the program has changed - in one window, instead of several independent ones (which causes difficulties in using many users).GIMPshop's functionality is identical to GIMP's. The program in relation to the original has, however, disadvantages - the lack of a Polish-language interface and a larger number of errors (this is most likely the result of the modifications used).
 
 Attention!
 In contrast to the original GIMPshop contains integrated GTK + libraries, so there is no need for their previous installation.
