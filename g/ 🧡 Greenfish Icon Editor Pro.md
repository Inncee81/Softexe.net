The tool is really nothing but a graphics program with extensive capabilities, which has been adapted to create and edit icons for Windows and Mac. It can also be successfully used for processing all kinds of graphics, and thanks to the support of the layer mechanism, it allows you to work on more complex graphic designs consisting of many independent elements.
 
 Greenfish Icon Editor Pro despite its small size offers a full set of tools for comprehensive work with icons. All of them are located on the panel in the left part of the program window, in which we find the most popular functions for selecting, drawing, trimming, applying shapes and lines to the project, filling or applying gradients. As with standard graphics processing software, the main application window also includes layer sections and a color picker.
 
 
 Other notable features include the card mechanism, allowing you to work with many icon files and graphics in one program window, as well as a set of a dozen or so filters, with the help of which we will increase the quality of our projects. They contain positions for color management, sharpening / blurring, transparency and shading. The application supports files in ICO, CUR, ANI, ICNS, PNG, XPM, BMP, JPG, GIF, PCX and other formats.
