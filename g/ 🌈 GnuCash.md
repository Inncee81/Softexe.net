The program allows you to create accounts in which we will save revenues (salary, pension, bank interest) and expenses for specific purposes (for example, food, entertainment, education, monthly ticket, etc.). Each entry is saved in accordance with the accounting principles, i.e. both the outgoings from our account and the revenue on the account summing up the expenses. Accounts can handle different currencies, data can be imported from Quicken (QIF) format, and exported to Open Financial Exchange (OFX).
 
 It is possible to print confirmation of operations and to plan their execution in the future. All data is displayed in a tree form, thanks to which it is possible to quickly access individual elements of our budget.
