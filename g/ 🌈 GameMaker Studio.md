The GameMaker environment offers all the necessary features for creating 2D games. The program uses drag &amp; drop technology, thanks to which it is possible to create a game only with the help of mouse movements, without programming skills. Of course, more advanced users can take advantage of the embedded GameMaker Language (GML) that gives full control over such elements as physics, particle emitters, object interaction and much more. The GML language also allows you to create integration modules with social networking sites, payment systems, etc.
 
 IDE allows you to manage the entire process of creating games from building the first outline concepts to ready projects with graphics, sound effects, fonts, etc. GameMaker is also adapted to group work on projects thanks to SVN support. In addition, the program offers a built-in Developer Services Portal (DSP) system that allows developers to monitor player activity and earn money by adding ads and in-app purchases to games.
 
 IDE GameMaker environment is available in 3 editions: Free, Professional and Master. Each of them offers additional features and includes a game export module for various platforms.Attention!
 
 
 The free version of GameMaker: Studio has several limitations. The application enables export of created games exclusively for Windows and limits the amount of resources used for the project.
 To use the free version of the program, you must create an account on the manufacturer's website and use the option of obtaining a free license there. The program must log in to the same account.
