> GeeTeeDee is a modern and free application whose task is to manage a list of tasks to be performed. The user can add any number of items to be made, group them into categories, and if necessary, also export all data to a text file.

The program, although it may not offer too rich functionality, is still a very interesting proposition for those who like to organize their time. Its greatest asset is the QT library, created on the basis of the Qt library, and a very polished and transparent graphical interface supporting the drag-and-drop method. Within it you will find options to create new tasks along with short notes and planned dates, create task categories and assign specific tasks to them, mark the activities performed and export full TODO lists to TXT files. There were also functions of editing and deleting unnecessary items, as well as viewing lists of tasks performed.
 
 In addition to the already mentioned advantages of the application, one should also mention its small size and low demand for system resources. Importantly, the developers have released versions for Windows, Linux and Mac OS.
