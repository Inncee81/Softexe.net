The earlier part of GTA had only one playable character, while in Grand Theft Auto V we have three main heroes, each with its own past, current goals and unique abilities. We learn about the history of Michael, Franklin and Trevor, acting both in Los Santos, where the vast majority of the plot campaign is taking place, as well as in the suburbs. During the game, we take part in spectacular shootings, dynamic chases, thefts, kidnappings, races and more.
 
 Grand Theft Auto V offers a lot of tasks related to the story and many additional activities, thanks to which production can provide at least a few dozen hours of gameplay. It only depends on us whether we decide to perform one mission after another, or whether we will go to the club to play darts, check our skills in sports competitions (eg triathlon), visit a strip club, buy real estate to enrich through perform optional tasks, or play on the stock market, trying to multiply your savings. Nothing also prevents you from buying better and super fast cars.
 
 It is worth adding that Grand Theft Auto V contains checkpoints during the mission, so that in the event of failure, we do not have to repeat the whole task again, but only the given fragment. If a player has problems with a certain stage, the game will display a message informing about the possibility of skipping the given level. This solution means that everyone - regardless of their skills and experience - will be able to reach the end credits.
