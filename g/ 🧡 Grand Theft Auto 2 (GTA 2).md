The first GTA grew to be a hit, but only Grand Theft Auto 2 really taught us that only the respect counts in the criminal world. The cult continuation took all the best features of the original and built an even bigger phenomenon on it. Just like it was with the original, Rockstar finally decided to release the second part of the series for free. You can see how it was before the 3D jump.

The title does not look bad even for today's standards, because it already supported hardware graphics acceleration. Together with a nicely smoothed image, appropriately filtered textures and good lighting effects, fantastic soundtrack goes. Some of the musical pieces played in the game in her radio stations are still hummed by more than one fan of the brand. Music creates a great atmosphere.
 
 
 The core of the game has not changed. We are still stealing cars and carrying out missions, with a focus on robberies. The earnings are still counted here, which unlocks access to the next districts of a slightly futuristic city. There is an option to save the game status in the church, of course for a fee. Again, the pickpocket will entertain trying to get the cash from our tough guy. GTA 2 also allows you to play online.
 
 Attention!
 
 The version of the game made available by the producer is a slightly modified version so that it is possible to play on modern hardware configurations. The creators do not guarantee, however, that the work will work in any case. Even the installer.
