Gaming Keyboard Splitter is a very useful tool created for fans of multiplayer games on one computer.

In the Windows operating system, we can of course connect many keyboards, but unfortunately they are treated as the same device, which makes it impossible to use them in computer games that offer multiplayer in local mode.
 
 The problem can be solved thanks to the Gaming Keyboard Splitter application, because it allows you to create up to four virtual Xbox 360 controllers that will receive input from these keyboards, which in turn will allow us to compete with family members, friends or friends on the same PC.
 
 Gaming Keyboard Splitter requires a lot of free time to be reserved, but only during the first start, when we are dealing with the configuration of the tool. We can not only pair each connected keyboard with the controller's socket, but also assign gamepad functions to each button on the keyboard. There is also an option to prepare predefined settings for specific games.
 
 It is worth mentioning that Gaming Keyboard Splitter requires the installation of a Microsoft Xbox 360 controller on Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 operating systems. Owners of newer versions of popular "windows" must install embedded drivers, and then restart the computer.
