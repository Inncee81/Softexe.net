It would seem that the backup of data from Gmail does not make the biggest sense, because we are dealing with the service offered by one of the most powerful companies in the world, Google, but it is worth to protect yourself and prepare a backup eg. If you block our account to mail e. In this situation, Gmvault comes with the help, which allows you to create a back-up of the entire contents of your e-mail in one directory.
 
 Gmvault offers access to the option to quickly synchronize data between our Gmail account and the contents of the backup so that it is always up-to-date. We can use this function at predefined intervals (eg once a day). It is worth adding that the data in the backup can be encrypted so that unauthorized persons do not gain access to our messages. This is an extremely useful solution for people who intend to store backup on a mobile device or "in the cloud".
 
 Importantly, Gmvault allows you to restore your backup to any email account, so if our previous account has been blocked, we can transfer all your data to a new account. 
 
 Attention!
 
 To be able to use Gmvault, please go to the "Forwarding and POP / IMAP" tab in your Gmail account settings to activate the IMAP service. After starting the described tool, enter the appropriate command: gmvault sync adres@gmail.com, click "enter", allow the application to access our Gmail account and paste the code visible on the screen into the gmvault main window.
