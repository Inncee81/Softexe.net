> GhostWriter - Markdown editor, which uses two interesting modes to affect productivity while writing texts. One is to highlight the most recent sentence in the color, while the second disables the use of the delete and backspace keys.

This approach is to force the user to write the content first and then to be interested in editing it and correcting it. This is to be more productive than dealing with on-line editing that can beat the writer from the rhythm. Both modes can be turned on and off at any time, so using them is not mandatory.
 
 In addition to the interesting modes, GhostWriter remains a functional Markdown editor in which you can independently control the interface colors, use keyboard shortcuts and analyze statistics of the document or session. Document navigation and preview of the work effect in HTML are also available.
