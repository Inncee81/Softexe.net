Any errors in the edited texts are recorded in real time by underlining together with information about the proposed amendments.
 
 The plugin can be successfully used, for example, when creating an e-mail message in Gmail or posting content on social networks Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Tumblr and any other text form available on almost any website.
 
 After registering a user account, weekly statistics reports will be sent to the mailbox. In the paid version, Grammarly has features to detect additional types of errors, suggest improvements in vocabulary or the detection of plagiarism.
