Garmin Express is the official application for Garmin GPS navigation management. It allows you to update navigation maps, share news with the Garmin Connect community, register devices to make their guarantees easier in the event of a fault, and even update golf course maps.

The application interface has been organized in the form of a minimalist wizard. Thanks to this, after connecting the device, adding it to the list of supported navigation and then selecting the action we want to perform, the whole operation will be carried out in such a way as not to omit any significant element.
 
 The program is characterized by low system requirements, so if we have an appropriate operating system, the application should work in practice regardless of the computer's configuration. Updating the maps may turn out to be a big demand for disk space - even a dozen or so gigabytes.
