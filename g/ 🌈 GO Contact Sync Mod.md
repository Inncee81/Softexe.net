 Thanks to this program, we will save time, because we will not have to enter data in both Outlook and Gmail - the application will handle data synchronization in real time or according to a set time (eg every two minutes). 
 
 Interestingly, GO Contact Sync Mod not only supports the Windows operating system, but also synchronizes user's contacts with Windows Phone 7, iPhone and Android via Google.
