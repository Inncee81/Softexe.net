GUNS UP! is a real-time strategy war game. The player forms troops, which will then assault the fortifications of the opponent. The gameplay, however, does not work to send next waves of cannon meat on the rampart - the ability to defend your own infrastructure will be equally important for victory.

The army can be built based on infantrymen, fire-thrower operators, sharpshooters, or even ... experts in chemical weapons. After the battles fought, soldiers can obtain veteran status, advance and gain new skills.
 
 It is equally important to defend your own infrastructure. The experience gained can be used by the player to expand the fortifications. The assault is carried out by waves, and the distribution of fortifications and buildings will be an invaluable help in repelling subsequent waves.
 
 From the technical side the game looks very nice - the comic graphics are polished, and the effects accompanying explosions on the battlefield make it even more dynamic and effective. The sound setting is equally fine. GUNS UP! is a free-to-play game, available as part of early access on the Steam platform.
