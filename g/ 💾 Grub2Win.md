Grub2Win is a very popular and free tool that performs the functions of a boot manager. Thanks to it, we can easily install more than one operating system on the hard disk - in such a way that after starting the computer we will be able to choose which environment will be loaded.

The tool copes very well with support for large media with a capacity of over 4 TB, while offering support for GTP and MBR disks. In addition, it supports EFI (32- and 64-bit), BIOS, as well as all the most popular file systems.
 
 It allows you to install Windows, Linux or Android systems side by side on one computer, allowing you to configure the boot loader using the GUI. A set of several interesting graphic motifs that can be used on the system selection screen at the start of the computer were given to the user.
