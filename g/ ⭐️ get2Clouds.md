> get2Clouds is a tool for very easy and quick sharing of files using the cloud.

The program supports the following services: Google Drive, Dropbox, Telecom Cloud, Microsoft SkyDrive, SugarSync, Box and several others. Of course, it is required to have an account in the service from which we intend to make use of using get2Clouds. In the main program window we can place data both by browsing the list of files and using the "drag and drop" function.
 
 You do not have to worry that our documents will fall into the wrong hands. get2Clouds uses advanced encryption algorithm (we configure the appropriate parameters a moment before placing the data on the server), thanks to which no one will be able to read them (except for the recipient, of course).
 
 Get2Clouds charges CPU and RAM to a negligible extent, without affecting the performance of the computer, which means that when sending data, we can freely use other programs, the internet or multimedia applications.
