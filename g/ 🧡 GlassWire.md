The program is characterized by simple operation and a modern and refined graphic interface, whose appearance can be changed thanks to the support of motifs. All available functions are arranged in special tabs. We find tools and options among them, used for graphical analysis of incoming and outgoing transfers, operation of the built-in firewall, monitoring the amount of data sent to / from the network, as well as notifying the user about the components connecting to the Internet.
 
 Apart from the possibility of general analysis of network connection usage, GlassWire can also be used to fight various types of pests. From its level, we can easily detect suspicious processes, eg stealing confidential data, and then block access to the Internet.
