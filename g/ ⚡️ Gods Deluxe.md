Gods Deluxe is a free project that will successfully renovate the hit platform from years ago. Very well-known work of the talented The Bitmap Brothers team was rewritten and adapted to work on modern computer sets. As a result, anyone can re-engage in a brave Hercule seeking immortality, or try to face his last job for the first time.

At first glance, it is a standard representative of the genre, but with a strong and well-armed hero in the main role, which eliminates more enemies. However, it quickly turns out that there are a lot of logic puzzles here, and the next steps are also better to think first, instead of running without breath. You have to measure the jump, you can fall off the ladder, losing your life, and going further will only open a good leverage.
 
 
 It is worth paying attention to the system of dynamic selection of difficulty challenges. We have a limited number to live. Enemies appear suddenly, depending on how we handle each other. The Deluxe version of the game offers several additional stages, and also has a built-in editor, so you can try to pull the story of a brave strongman away. It is worth to collect valuables, because we will buy better weapons for them.
