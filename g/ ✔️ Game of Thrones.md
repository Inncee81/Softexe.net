What is the Game about the Throne about?
 
 Game of Thrones contains only a story campaign (the game does not have a multiplayer), in which we get the opportunity to learn two completely different stories. We will direct both Morshe Westford, or one of the members of the Night Watch, and we will play as Alester, who belongs to the extremely rich family of Sarwyck. In addition to missions closely related to the scenario, we will also receive many optional tasks to do.
 
 For the needs of Game of Thrones, an extensive character development system has been developed. With the progress of the game, we will be able to advance to the next levels of experience, increase the statistics of the heroes, as well as unlock completely new abilities. All skills will prove very useful during real-time tactical battles.
