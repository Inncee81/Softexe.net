The application allows us to communicate with other users of the communicator, both in text mode, voice mode, as well as audio-video. It offers the functions of spell checking, archiving all conducted text conversations, card mechanism allowing communication with many people from one window, built-in radio, emoticons, avatars, also allowing convenient transfer of files and graphics between users and blocking unwanted contacts.
 
 Against the background of competitive solutions of this type, GG 12 stands out, among others built-in e-mail client and the option of playing games for two. Mention is also worth about a virtual disk, under which we can store 5 GB of free data for free on external servers of the manufacturer. Its advantage is the ability to automatically synchronize files between computers on which we use the communicator and easy sharing with friends.
