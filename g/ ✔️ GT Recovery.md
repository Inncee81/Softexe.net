The described tool offers several operating modes and allows both quick (restoration of files with all data) and advanced data recovery from a computer (restoring as many files as possible), and also allows for data recovery from mobile devices (the function is currently in the phase beta testing). Additionally, using GT Recovery, you can save the scan results.
 
 GT Recovery is very easy to use and does not require specialized knowledge on the part of the user. After scanning, a list of files that can be restored is displayed on the screen - select the required data from the list and then press the start button. However, before we carry out this operation, we will be able to read the details of individual files (the system intelligently divides them by type and path of recording).
