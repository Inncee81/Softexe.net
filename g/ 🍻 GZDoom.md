Doom is a legend and what not to say about the modern three-dimensional parts of the series, the first two parts will remain forever in the hearts of shooter enthusiasts. However, they appeared originally for the DOS system and currently their launch is not so super simple. Here, GZDoom comes with the help of a free modification of the original engine, streamlining the aging old FPS hits from many years ago.

Compatibility with newer operating systems is one thing, but there are many more changes under the lining. It is primarily a selection of higher resolutions. At first glance, this may not be noticed, but the stages may use much more geometrically advanced shapes. Worked on realistic and dynamic lighting and the effects associated with it. Directly from the options in the game menu, you get access to numerous graphics, sound or fun settings.
 
 
 Not everyone brought up on contemporary FPP positions will immediately find themselves in a dynamic, somewhat chaotic action that has been promoted by Dooms and subsequent variations maintained in fantasy climates. For them, there is the possibility of using automatic records, and in the options of the game, there is a whole range of facilities available to them, including infinite ammunition or any look around, which was not in the original. Added to this include jumping and moving in squatting.
 
 
 Attention!
 
 In this version for fun, you do not need DOSBox , because everything works under Windows. It is required to download files with the extension WAD, which contain Doom game data, to the GZDoom root directory and select them from the list at the start. The files from the free shareware edition of the blockbuster are also supported , as well as the Heretic and Hexen demo games on the same engine, plus naturally different fan maps.
