> GIFmicro is a small application to minimize the size of graphic files saved in the title GIF format. The program primarily allows for lossless weight reduction graphics, however, if the need arises, it will also be able to generate files with slightly lower quality, but for a much higher efficiency in the minimization of memory usage.

To use the potential of the program, you should indicate the source files - the easiest way is to simply drag them to the work window from any other level in the explorer. Loaded files are presented on the list together with information about the current size and path. The top bar has a button to start the process of reducing graphics. It will include options that can be edited from the settings advanced to the right of the interface.
 
 Among the preferences we find, first and foremost, the possibility to choose the number of analysis runs, which affects the efficiency of file reduction (the consequence is a longer duration of operation) and additional options related to more aggressive action, that is, taking into account the resolution change and reducing the overall quality of graphics. The application allows you to reduce GIF files by an average of 2-6%.
