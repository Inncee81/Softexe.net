The program allows the user to capture the image from the indicated area of ​​the screen, both in the static form as well as in the short animation. After performing any of the above-mentioned activities, the application automatically places the captured file on the manufacturer's external server, making it easy to share it with friends. It is enough to copy the appropriate link from the browser and send it, for example, via the messenger.
 
 Gyazo can be activated by pressing the PrtSc key on the keyboard. The application also offers support for keyboard shortcuts facilitating the initiation of screen creation or animation.
