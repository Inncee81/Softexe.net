The file viewer in GonVisor allows you to open standard files, comics saved in CBR, CBZ, CBA and CB7 formats, images, PDF documents, compressed files (RAR, ZIP, ACE, 7ZIP) and unpacking photo galleries. There is also a possibility to use the bookmarks, thanks to which we can continue reading from the place where we finished.
 
 GonVisor allows creating CBZ files and CZB files (they can be password protected) containing a group of selected images that can be placed in a specific order. We will provide the prepared file with an additional description (author, date, type, comment). Users will appreciate the presence of an easy-to-use file finder, which indicates which comics we have read or started reading them. It is worth adding that it is also possible to create a slide show with the function of setting the transition time between consecutive images.
 
 The tool can boast of an uncomplicated, intuitive user interface that makes browsing e-books or digital books in a digital form will not cause problems for even less experienced recipients. You can automatically reduce the margins or delete them completely, for example to see the photo on the entire screen. When you read it, you display the content on two sides side by side, and if you find that the font is unreadable, you will use the magnifying glass. The tool is fully configurable - you can customize it in many ways so that using it with the mouse and keyboard is comfortable for you.
 
 Attention!
 
 The installation wizard offers the user to install additional components. They are not required to run the program and we do not recommend installing them.
