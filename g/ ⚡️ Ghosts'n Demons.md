The cult game Ghosts'n Goblins, which in times of splendor of slot machines was also extremely popular in Poland, has already decades on the back of the neck, but still gains new fans. All this thanks to free spiritual heirs, prepared by talented home programmers. The Ghosts'n Demons project successfully continues the tradition of the original. He's good at ambition.

We are dealing here with a classic school of games, which means a high level of difficulty and the need to show off with great skill. The brave Sir Arthur sets out on a mission to rescue his beloved demons in knight's armor. When he loses his armor, then only one blow separates him from death. For this reason, the passage of the first level will separate the toughness from the weak.
 
 
 Although the work is driven by a quite modern, open source technology, which underlies many free fighting games, it is especially stylized for something not from the modern era. Graphic design is a beautiful pixelose with an effect of imitating interlace, which can be additionally strengthened in options. The soundtrack, also referring to the good old days, goes hand in hand with this, of course.
