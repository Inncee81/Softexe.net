The program has been equipped with a rich set of functions for drawing various types of lines, shapes, and dimensioning in two- and three-dimensional space. Individual tools are grouped on tabs in the ribbon interface. GstarCAD allows you to work with ACIS solids, and also offers support for DXF and DWG files (created eg in AutoCAD from version 2.5 to 2012). Importantly, when they are opened, no conversion is made, so there is no loss of any data. In addition, the environment supports commands, scripts, styles, formulas, etc. known from the Autodesk product.
 
 GstarCAD thanks to hardware USB keys gives you the opportunity to work with one license on many computers, as well as network work (so-called floating license). The environment is equipped with a VBA editor, it is compatible with SDS and GRX (equivalent to ARX), it gives the possibility to use Lisp / Vlisp scripts and ensures full data exchange with Excel. The program copes well when working with advanced and developed projects, and also works with many industry overlays, including CADprofi, BiK, Mapa_SG in the field of architecture, mechanics, electrics, steel structures, reinforced concrete, ventilation, geodesy and others.
 
 The latest version is based on a new engine, optimized for speed and the use of operational resources. GstarCAD enables exporting in DWFX, STL, EPS, DXX formats, importing from SAT, 3DS, WMF files and publishing in PDF, as well as 3D DWF.
 Attention!
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
