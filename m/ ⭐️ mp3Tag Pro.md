If you want to take care of the order in the song library, it is worth to describe them with various tags in order to be able to quickly locate the relevant songs later. mp3Tag Pro allows you to download such information directly from the web (Amazon, FreeDB, Discogs, MusicBrainz), where you will also find covers, which also download to your computer's hard drive and display next to the list of pieces of the given artist or band. However, this is not all information about the files that are displayed, which will display the described tool. We will know the year of the release of the album, the list of songs, song lyrics and much more about favorite artists.
 
 mp3Tag Pro can of course edit ID3 tags, supports tags ID3v1, ID3v2 and Lyrics3 contained in MP3 files, and if we have tags saved as CSV, we will import them into the program without problems. It is also possible to work the other way, that is exporting tags (not only to CSV, but also to TSV and XLS). It is also worth adding that the mentioned words of songs can be displayed directly in the application or stored in a separate document.
 
 Music fans will also appreciate the fact that mp3Tag Pro offers the function of creating playlists that we will use in the media player. In addition, your favorite songs can also be saved as bookmarks.
 
 Attention!
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days.
