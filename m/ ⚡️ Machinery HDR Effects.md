It is possible using only one photograph of a given object. However, it should not be forgotten that in order for the effect to be the best one should have three photos of the same frame, made using a tripod and various exposure values. Machinery HDR Effects is also well suited for correcting imperfections caused, for example, when shooting under inappropriate conditions or using poor camera settings. It offers options to adjust contrast, saturation, brightness level, smoothing, sharpness, etc.
 
 Each of the created parameter configurations can be saved and used when editing subsequent images. For the novice users, the creator has prepared a set of pre-defined settings, thanks to which they can easily "add" their photos. Machinery HDR Effects offers support for NVIDIA graphics cards, the program on high-speed cards works up to 15 times faster than on a standard CPU.Attention!
 The test version Machinery has several restrictions that prevent saving the generated image in its original size and write to the 16-bit TIFF format. If you want to avoid them, you should purchase the full version of the program - its price is PLN 99. In addition, the trial version allows you to use the program for 45 days.
