Microsoft OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) is a small application that allows access to data stored as part of the OneDrive service offered by Microsoft, directly from the operating system (without the need to launch an Internet browser).

After installing and correctly logging in to the service, the application allows you to save and read data that we have collected on the OneDrive online disk. Access to it is possible from the level of a special folder whose location is determined during the initial configuration of the tool. Working with it looks the same as in the case of an ordinary directory on the local disk - the user can easily create new folders in it, move and delete files, rename them etc. Microsoft OneDrive also offers the function of synchronizing data between all computers and smartphones where we installed the client application and logged in to your account.
 
 Application management can be done from the icon, which is available in the system tray. It gives the possibility to conveniently increase (purchase) the capacity of our internet disk, open its contents in a web browser and change basic settings. We find among them, among others the option of remote access to files, which is responsible for nothing else but data synchronization, and automatic launch of the OneDrive service during the start of the operating system.
 
 The huge advantage of the Microsoft OneDrive application is cross-platform. It is available for Windows and Mac OS, as well as smartphones working under the control of Android, iOS or Windows Phone.
