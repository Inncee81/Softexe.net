Each added task can be additionally described, created for him a notification and the date in which it is to be performed. Based on this data, the built-in algorithm checks in which order we should proceed to performing scheduled tasks in order to do it as effectively as possible.
 
 The lists created in the application can be slightly adapted to the visual aspect. There is a change of the leading color and the theme that appears in the background.
 
 The program synchronizes between platforms and offers integration with the Microsoft Office office suite, including tasks known from Outlook. The Microsoft user account is used for synchronization.
