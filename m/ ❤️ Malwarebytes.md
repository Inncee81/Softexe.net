> Malwarebytes is a somewhat unusual security software that allows detection and removal of various types of malicious software. Thanks to it, we will get rid of viruses, worms, Trojans, rootkits, dialers and spyware from the computer. It can be an addition to already used third-party software.

The application is unusual due to the fact that it is not a "typical anti-virus". It is a stand-alone scanner which, in the extended version, monitors used files and viewed websites. This software is useful primarily when other anti-viruses fail, or when we are not sure if our computer is clean. Thanks to Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, we will detect infected files, spyware and potentially unwanted applications (so-called PUPs). We can use the program even with a different, complete protection set. It complements the protection that is activated, for example, only at the express request of the user.
 
 The program is very easy to use. It offers several types of scans, including quick scans and user-designated areas. MBAM not only checks files, but also browser data and system registry, which allows it to delete even hidden threats. The program updates virus signatures on a daily basis, its settings allow to exclude specific areas of the disk and websites from scanning. An extensive task schedule is also available, where you can set up an automated task such as updates and scans performed in the background. If necessary, it is possible to block access to the program with a password.
 
 
 Attention!
 
 There is also a Premium version of the program that offers active protection against exploits and ransomware. You can buy it using the "Buy full version" button at the top of the page.
