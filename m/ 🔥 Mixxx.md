The program through two built-in players allows you to combine and mix two songs together. The user's options include changing the tempo, panorama, volume of the music being played, as well as amplifying selected tones. For beginners, a set of ready-made filters has been prepared to facilitate work with the program and to achieve interesting effects. Mixxx sets the tempo of songs in BPM, thus allowing the synchronization of individual sound channels. It also contains basic functions for queuing tracks and so-called cross-fading.
 
 Mixxx supports multi-channel sound cards and is compatible with low latency drivers. It supports MIDI controllers: DJ Console MK2, RMX, Stanton SCS.3d and others, while allowing, after the right connection of the turntable, to the music being played through it. It supports multi-core processors.
 
 The tool supports audio files in WAV, OGG, MP3, AIFF, FLAC and playlist formats PLS, M3U, allowing you to record mixed tracks to WAV and AIFF files. It also offers a skin mechanism, giving the user the ability to customize the appearance of the interface to their liking. The advantage of Mixxx is the availability of the program for Windows, Linux and Mac OS platforms.Attention!
