```sh
Mach2 is an open tool for people who want to test not only explicit features in the Windows builds of developers, but also those excluded by Microsoft at an early stage of development.

Mach2 works from the command line. Using the appropriate options, you can read all enabled and disabled functions, saved in Feature Controland enable or disable selected ones.
 
 In addition, the tool allows you to easily restore the settings to the default state for a given build of Windows. This is important from the point of view of system stability. Many of the inactive Windows features have not been enabled because they are unstable or are only usable on selected builds or hardware configurations.
 
 Using this program can seriously damage your system. Do not change settings on systems that we are not willing to sacrifice for the test.
