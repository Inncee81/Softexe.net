The program's interface has been designed to ensure that the clips can be clipped precisely at low cost. The program can also mount the supplied films to the music. There are several hundred effects, transitions, inputs, outputs and subtitle templates available for the user, which can be further adapted. 
 
 
 When mounting materials from different cameras, you can use proDAD image stabilization and automatically adjust the clips to the pattern to get a harmonious combination. What's more, the program allows you to mount and synchronize shots from various cameras - up to four. 
 
 
 Ready videos can be sent straight to Vimeo, where you can watch them without advertising.
 
 
 MAGIX Movie Edit Pro Plus can be tested for a week, and after free registration for a month. The test version of the program only exports 3 minutes of the movie.
