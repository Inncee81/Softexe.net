With the help of MultiExtractora we can easily find, extract or extract hidden images and textures from files saved in such formats as: 3DS, BMP, CUR, DDS, EMF, FON, GIF, ICO, IFF, JPG, LWO, PCX, PNG, TGA, TIFF, TTC, TTF, WMF. The application also copes well with work on sound files (MID, MOD, MP3, OGG, S3M, WAV, XM) and video materials (3GP, ASF, AVI, BIK, DAT, FLC, MOV, MP4, MPG, MPQ, SMK , SWF), supporting the most popular data formats. However, this is not all, because MultiExtractor is also an image converter (ICO, BMP, JPG, PNG and GIF).
 
 MultiExtractor also offers the option of unpacking special files, thanks to which it will successfully find recognition among more demanding users. With it, we can extract data from the Microsoft installer (MSI), JAR files, Office documents (as a ZIP archive), as well as Windows help files stored in HTML (CHM). The tool also detects packed executable and DLL files, offering the option of unpacking them.
 
 It is worth adding that MultiExtractor allows you to filter data for easier location. The user is provided with sorting files at their size, dimensions or quality. You can also specify file extensions during filtering.
