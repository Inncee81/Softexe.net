Mattermost is an open-source tool that can be an interesting alternative to the popular Slack (the application also plays the role of the client of the mentioned service).

We are dealing here with a program that facilitates communication in a group. For people working remotely, it turns out to be really useful, because Mattermost offers not only the ability to send messages (including attachments) to all users, but also to individual people in our team. Importantly, Mattermost offers full integration with a variety of social services and applications; in addition, it allows you to create and share your own programs.
 
 Mattermost offers the function of importing users, the history of public channels and other elements previously defined by people using Slack. In this case, we describe the version for computers with the Windows operating system, but it should be remembered that on the official website of the producer there are other program editions available (eg for iOS or Android mobile devices), and individual entries are synchronized in real time between them. .
