Unlike other programs of this type, Mobirise is characterized by a minimal user interface, which can be mastered even by less experienced recipients. The application offers the possibility of preparing small and large websites, as well as allows you to prepare product pages (landing pages), CVs and portfolios, and even websites promoting various events.
 
 Mobirise does not require specialized knowledge of web site programming and is free of charge for both commercial and non-profit applications. All operations are performed by moving various blocks visible from the main program window.
 
 Each page created with the Mobirise application can be published on a local disk, FTP server or also use services such as Amazon S3, Google Drive or Github.
