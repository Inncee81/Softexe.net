Matroska is a multimedia container developed since 2003, giving the possibility of storing audio and video tracks, subtitles, menus, etc. within one file with MKV extension. It was written with the aim of creating a flexible multimedia container format independent of the operating system. Importantly, Matroska is an open source and completely free platform for encoding audio-visual materials for a whole spectrum of needs, including streaming on the Internet. Its great advantage is the wide possibility of recovering damaged components included in a given container. 
 
 The features offered by the program are most often used to convert MKV files into many popular formats and to add and combine several films within a container. MKVToolNix also allows you to add or remove a soundtrack, subtitles, graphic files and many other components from the container. With his help, we will additionally "extract" the subtitles and sound from the film and divide it into chapters.
