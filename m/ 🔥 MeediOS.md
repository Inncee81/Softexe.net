The program can boast of an intuitive interface that has been designed to make it easier to navigate through your multimedia library even when we have a huge collection. MeediOS allows you to customize the appearance to your preferences in many different ways. It is only up to us how the application will display individual files. Less experienced recipients will appreciate simplicity, while more advanced options have been prepared in the configuration editor.
 
 MeediOS compiles in one place primarily movies, TV programs, music, photos and games, and even multimedia available via the Internet (eg streams). We can play them in many of the most popular file formats, on various types of media supported by the application, both on physical discs and digital copies.
