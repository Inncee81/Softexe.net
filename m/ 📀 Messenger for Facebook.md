After installation, the extension is visible in the browser as a small icon, the clicking of which opens the communicator window. It offers the same functions as the Messenger shared on the official page of the social networking site Facebook. It enables convenient communication with friends without opening the website mentioned above. The communicator is operated through a small window containing a list of contacts, a conversation history and a set of additional options.
 
 Messenger for Facebook allows you to conduct standard text conversations, as well as making voice calls and video chat rooms. There were also options to transfer files and photos, use stickers, animations or popular emoji. The user has also been given options to configure the chat window with selected friends, notifications or the built-in search engine or the history of shared files.
