The program is mainly addressed to students and students as a tool to improve the learning and memorizing process. However, it can also be used successfully for easy presentation of ideas and action plans. Thanks to the large possibilities beyond the standard creation of simple schemas, Mindomo also allows you to add various types of multimedia and links to external sources.
 
 Mindomo offers, by default, several types of mind maps, but nothing prevents the user from creating his own personalized diagrams. The program gives the possibility to manipulate many visual aspects of created mind maps - selection of colors, fonts or type of connections between elements. The option of brainstorming and collaboration of many users in real time is also important.
 
 The application has been equipped with a presentation mode and integrates with Google Drive, Dropbox and any FTP server. Mindomo allows you to import mind maps from external programs and save created works to PDF, RTF, PPT, TXT, OPML, MPX, HTML, ZIP and PNG formats.
