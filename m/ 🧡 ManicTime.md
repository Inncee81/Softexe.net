ManicTime is a program to track user activity on a computer with a Windows operating system. It can be successfully used at home as well as in small or larger enterprises.

Thanks to ManicTime, we will monitor user activity (working time with a given program, list of websites visited, running applications, etc.). At the same time, the tool can also be used to obtain information about the person's inactivity. By using the program in the company, we will receive a sign that the employee is not at the computer (because, for example, he went out for a break).
 
 All information collected by ManicTime is presented in a clear form using a graphical chart. In addition, you can create an activity report for the selected user and save it, for example, in Microsoft Excel. This can be extremely useful when you want to find out what program the child uses most and how much time he spends with the computer.
 
 ManicTime has been designed so that all data is stored on the local computer, which in practice means that it does not require an internet connection and works the same way both offline and online.
