The program must be installed on a computer that we will remotely control from a smartphone or tablet. In the server settings, you can set a password for connecting to the application and enable the automatic start of the program with the system. 
 
 
 The application on the smartphone should itself find a working server, if the devices will be on the same network. If necessary, you can also check the computer's IP number. There are also redirects to application stores, which allow you to quickly download applications for mobile devices.
