One of the greatest advantages of the program is its simplicity. It has not been created to compete with extensive video editing packages, but it works perfectly in simple tasks that even a novice user can do without problems. The offered functionality enables cutting selected fragments of material, creating separate video files from them, replacing them with other videos, capturing individual frames and saving them in the form of a screenshot (file in BMP format), as well as removing a soundtrack from the movie. The creators equipped the application with the tag editor options and a function providing detailed information about the loaded video file.
 
 The free version offers one significant limitation. Machete Video Editor Lite allows you to play and edit video files only in AVI and WMV formats.
