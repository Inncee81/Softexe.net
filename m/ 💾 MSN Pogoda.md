MSN Pogoda is undoubtedly one of the best weather applications that provides detailed meteorological information for selected locations (there can be as many of them as possible).

The application was created by Microsoft and made available free of charge to all users of Windows 8 and 10 systems. It provides data on current weather conditions in cities selected by us. They contain, among others current temperature, perceived temperature, barometer, wind direction and strength, humidity, visibility or dew point temperature.
 
 However, this is not the end, MSN Weather also provides hourly and 10-day forecasts in addition to current meteorological conditions, as well as information on sunrise and sunset / moon, UV index and aura at a given time over the last 30 years. From the application level we also get access to interactive radar maps, temperature, precipitation, cloud cover and satellite.
 
 The MSN Weather application has been made available for computers, mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) as well as Xbox gaming consoles.
