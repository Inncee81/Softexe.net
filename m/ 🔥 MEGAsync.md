Deciding to use the MEGA service, the user receives 50 GB of disk space on the producer's servers, on which he can collect his files. As a standard, the data transfer process can only be carried out using an internet browser. A much more convenient solution, however, is the MEGAsync client application, which operates within the system tray and gives the possibility of efficient synchronization of the entire account or only selected folders. A special tool-related catalog (in the location indicated by the user) is created on the computer disk, the content of which is automatically synchronized with our account on the external server.
 
 The application is very easy to use and offers options to configure its operation in accordance with the user's preferences. It is possible, among others management of the bandwidth limit, defining proxy servers, as well as file names excluded from synchronization. There were, of course, the option to run the tool with the start of Windows.
 
 Attention!
 
 By default, when creating an account, the user receives 50 GB for his files free of charge. The service providers offer commercial accounts with plans that can reach up to 2 TB. More information on this subject can be found on the official website of the MEGA service.
