According to the name, the program allows exploration of the Mandelbulb type of fractal, as well as Mandelbox, BulbBox, JuliaBulb, Menger sponge, and the iterated transformation system (IFS). Figures rendered by the program can be enlarged indefinitely in the preview window, just like two-dimensional fractals. But because the figures have 3 dimensions, there is the possibility of viewing them from every side, and even "entering the camera inside them", which gives interesting effects especially when creating animations. The program also allows you to modify the parameters of tracking rays, the intensity of light and the addition of volumetric light effects. The material from which the figure is made can be colored using one of the random gradients, or creating its own gradient based on graphics, and the material can be given a reflective, luminous appearance, define shadows and activate ambient occlusion on its surface. The last render can be rendered using fog and depth of field. When creating animations, you can also define the speed of camera movement between key frames and the number of frames between them. 
 
 
 To familiarize yourself with the details of the program's operation and learn about the possibilities of parameters, please refer to the user's manual . It is also worth taking a look at the pictures and films created in this program. The author recommends the use of a multi-core processor machine, but this is not necessarily - on a weaker computer, it will simply take longer to wait for results.
 
 attention
 
 The program installation takes place in the user's folder. To move all files to the right place, run the script install.bat. After the script is finished, you can start the program mandelbulber.exe.
