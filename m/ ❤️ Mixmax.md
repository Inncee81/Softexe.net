Mixmax is a small extension for the Google Chrome browser, which allows you to significantly increase the number of functions of the browser version of Gmail, as well as integrate it with external sites. Significant changes are visible in such an elementary matter as the creation and sending of messages.

In the Mixmax settings, for example, you can create ready-made templates, sending a message can also be delayed by the selected interval (from one hour to one week) or set an automatic sending in a specific time of your choice. In addition, in the message creation window there was an option to enable reminders for a given conversation and to track it with the option of messages on the desktop. This in turn allows access to information whether, when and by whom the message was read.
 
 Mixmaks also allows you to add different types of external content to your e-mail. You can attach a form with questions, calendar event or table, as well as YouTube video preview, Twitter twitter, Instagram pictures and many other content from various types of websites.
 
 The program also expands the available Gmail configuration options by default and presents them in a clear and elegant interface much more convenient to navigate than the original one.
