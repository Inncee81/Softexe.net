The application allows you to perform many types of operations on partitions such as their creation, resizing, copying, converting, hiding or recovering. The program works well with many editions of Windows, both 32 and 64-bit versions. In addition, the MiniTool Partition Wizard Free guarantees trouble-free support for RAID arrays and hard drives with a capacity of more than 2 TB, well copes well with the change of the file system from FAT to NTFS.
 
 In addition, the program offers the ability to use the Copy Disk Wizard or visualization (Disk Map). It allows you to familiarize yourself with the distribution of partitions and disks using a graphical presentation. We can also use several tests such as, for example, Disk Surface Test or Partition Surface Test.
