> Movavi Photo Studio is a set of three tools for photographers gathered by the producer in one place. The set includes the editor Movavi Photo Editor, a tool for mass processing graphic files Movavi Photo Batch and Movavi Slideshow Creator, which can combine photos and videos in an attractive presentation.

The advantage of Movavi Photo Studio is the ability to purchase and install all three Movavi programs for photographers at once. Thanks to this, you can prepare individual photos, perform a simple retouch or convert entire collections, and then make a presentation ready to be placed on YouTube and show to your friends. 
 
 
 Of course, you can buy each of the programs separately, but with the Movavi Photo Studio you can have them at around $ 20 cheaper than if they were bought separately.
 
 
 The programs included in the test version of Movavi Photo Studio can be tested together or separately. The trial version editor does not allow you to save files, Photo Batch allows you to process a total of 100 photos and does not give access to the full collection of supported file formats, and the tool for creating film slideshows only works for a week.
