The possibilities of the application do not end there. Makagiga, thanks to the system of plugins, can carry out calculations (by connecting with Wolfram Alpha) and display maps (OpenStreetMap). The program can also display Polish holidays in the calendar, present the current weather, highlight the code's syntax, manage document templates or generate QR codes.
 
 The program's interface is clear and understandable - anyone who can deal with, for example, Thunderbird or Outlook, will also cope with this tool, especially since it has been completely polonized. Appearance of the application can be modified to a certain extent thanks to the skin system. The tool integrates correctly with the KDE desktop and Windows 7, it performs a bit worse on OS X.
 
 Attention!
 The program requires Java Runtime Enviroment libraries installed in the system. The latest version of Java Runtime Enviroment can be downloaded in the PROGRAMS section -&gt; Extras -&gt; Libraries and other add-ons (see: Related Programs).
