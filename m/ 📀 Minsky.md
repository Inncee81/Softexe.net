> Minsky is a proposal for all those who are interested in macroeconomics, and do not fully believe in neoclassical economic models, with their well-informed rational agents, operating in unchanging reality and ignoring the dialectical nature of money, debt and the banking system.

The 20th-century American economist Hyman Minsky is the author of a completely different approach, in which the economy is perceived as a chaotic (in a mathematical sense) creation, regulated by money and debt. Hyman Minsky is the author of the hypothesis about the fundamental property of a free market economy, which is a cyclical transition from the states of flowering to disasters.
 
 Minsky is a simulator of such a chaotic economy, which was created in 2013 thanks to the funding provided by the Kickstarter collection, with the hope that it will allow people to open their eyes to certain economic mechanisms. He presents them using flow diagrams and so-called Godley's tables. Its applications do not end with macroeconomics - in theory it can be used to simulate any chaotic phenomena.
