> Mischief is a painting program that has gained fame thanks to an unlimited workspace that we can zoom in and out. The program works very well with graphic tablets and allows you to paint on layers.

The program interface is very simple - it consists of a tray with tools and three palettes, allowing you to work on layers, choose brushes and manipulate the color. Each of these palettes can be enlarged to gain access to more possibilities.
 We have here 6 basic types of brushes and 6 corresponding erasers. The brushes can be used to determine the transparency and change the width under the pressure of the tablet pen pressure, if the type of brush gives such a possibility. You can also draw using vector shapes, and you can select, copy, delete and paste parts of a drawing.
 
 Drawing is very natural and if you run out of space, you can not worry about it and simply move the work area. You can use tools from the palette or gestures on the touch screen, tablet or laptop trackpad. If the image consists of several layers, you have to expect minor rendering delays. When exporting an image to one of the popular graphic formats, you can choose to export the visible area or selected fragment.
 
 The color palette is very simple. The color can be selected on it, in the enlarged version also giving the RGB color code, or using a color picker. You can drag your favorite colors to the pop-up list. 
 
 
 Finally, it's worth adding that the full version of the program has the ability to export files in PSD format while preserving layers. You can also change the transparency of the entire window to help you draw based on the underlying image. 
 
 
 The trial version allows you to draw without restrictions for 15 days. The full version of the program costs $ 25.
