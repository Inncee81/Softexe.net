> MAGIX Photostory Deluxe is an advanced program for creating effective slide shows from personal collections of photos and videos.

Shows can be presented in resolutions up to 4K, also in 3D.

The program has a collection of aesthetic thematic templates that can be used to create your own show in a matter of seconds. The project can be enriched with over 300 effects and over 400 sounds and songs. Nothing prevents you from doing everything from scratch and without a template to fine-tune every detail.
 
 Graphics, movies and sounds can be freely placed on 8 paths. The program allows the processing of panoramic materials and recorded with 360 Â° webcams. Pictures can be improved when placing in the show, and for movies, use image stabilization using the professional proDAD Mercalli V2 plugin. We also have effective transitions, entrances and exits, templates for inscriptions, frames and other decorative elements. It is worth mentioning above all about the possibility of animating the travel route on the map. The icing on the cake is the ability to work with the Camera MX application .
 
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 7 days. It is possible to extend the period to 30 days by registering on the manufacturer's website.
 The installation wizard offers the user to install additional components in the system. They are not required for the correct operation of the program and we do not recommend installing them.
