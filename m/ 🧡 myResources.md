By default, the tool will inform the user about the degree of CPU, RAM and hard disk utilization in the form of transparent icons visible in the upper right corner of the screen (they can be freely moved to any other place on the desktop or on the taskbar). By clicking on the selected icon, we will open a real-time graph, thanks to which we will learn more about these components of our PC.
 
 myResources is automatically minimized to the system tray, from which we can call it right-click (just click on any program icon). Numerous settings will allow us to customize the application to your preferences. We decide whether we want to monitor both CPU, RAM and HDD, or just selected systems. We will also modify the appearance of individual icons, as well as the way they are displayed.
