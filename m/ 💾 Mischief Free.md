Mischief Free is a free and slightly trimmed version of the Mischief painting program, which became famous for its "infinite canvas".

In the free version of the program, of course, we find the flagship feature of Mischief, which is an unlimited area on which we can draw. We have here a simple palette of colors, 3 brushes, 3 corresponding erasers, a color picker and tools for moving and zooming the working area.
 
 In full-screen mode, you can call the program menu with the right mouse button or a button on the pen, you can also navigate with gestures on the touch screen or trackpad.
 
 
 It is a very simple product that works great with a pen tablet and will certainly work in the hands of less demanding drawers and with quick sketches. An interesting fact is that you can set the transparency of the entire window, which can help you redraw your photos. The drawings can be saved in the format appropriate for the program (and they will not be large at all despite the huge workspace) or exported in one of the popular graphic formats.
