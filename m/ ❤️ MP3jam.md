MP3jam is a small tool that gives you the ability to search, listen and download selected songs and save them as MP3 files. The program is based on the popular YouTube website and the VK social network, giving us access to over 20 million songs.

The big advantage of MP3jam is its carefully crafted graphical interface. It is transparent, easy to use and will certainly appeal to the majority of recipients. The main program window includes categories with various types of music (including classical, hip-hop, jazz, metal, pop, r &amp; b or rock), in which we will find catalogs with works of the most popular artists in the world. There was, of course, a built-in search engine allowing you to find our favorite songs quickly and conveniently.
 
 Both in the case of using the built-in search engine, as well as the music catalog offered, all songs are displayed in the form of albums. The user has the ability to play songs and download full albums or only selected tracks. There were also links to the source, transferring us to one of the websites where the given song is available. The program also contains an archive containing information about all searched / played / downloaded items.
 
 Attention!
 
 The installation wizard offers the user to install additional components, including in the web browser. They are not required for the correct operation of the program and we do not recommend installing them.
 
 The program requires .NET Framework libraries installed in version 4.0 or newer. The latest version of the .NET Framework can be downloaded in the section PROGRAMS -&gt; Add-ons -&gt; Libraries and other add-ons (see: Related Programs).
