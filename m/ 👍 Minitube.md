One of the most important functions is the ability to watch videos without using the Adobe Flash Player. This is due to less use of processor resources and greater battery savings on laptops. Minitube also offers a new, interesting way to watch video clips - just enter the keyword, and the program will search for relevant videos and play them in infinite sequence, one by one. Of course, the user can choose the resolution of the movie he wants to view and also display the clips in full-screen mode.
 
 Like the YouTube website, Minitube also offers content browsing in terms of relevance, the latest and most popular files.
