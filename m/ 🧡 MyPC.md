With the help of MyPC we will be able to get acquainted with the basic data of your operating system, systems installed under the PC case, network connection, and also get access to information related to autostart, temporary network files and a directory with the history of the web browser. More advanced users will appreciate that MyPC also displays details about the BIOS, running processes and memory usage.
  
 MyPC is also a kind of control center that allows you to create a system restore point (or even deactivate this function), run a Windows update, shutdown and restart your computer. It is possible to delete temporary files, clean the clipboard or the basket. Thanks to this, we will gain more space on the hard disk and accelerate the operation of the operating environment.
