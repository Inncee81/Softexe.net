```sh
mpFaktura is an integrated software allowing to display any sales and purchase documents, running warehouses, preparing offers, order processing, etc. Thanks to this application, we can run any store (has numerous mechanisms to improve the service of retail clients), a warehouse or a service company. However, despite its extensive features, it is also ideally suited as a solution for small, one-man companies, or so-called freelancers - to issue simple invoices for customers.

Attention! From January 1, 2018, the obligation to keep electronic VAT records and to submit them as a Uniform Control File (JPK) is introduced. The mpFaktura program is prepared for these changes and allows you to generate JPK-VAT, JPK-FA and JPK-MAG files.
 
 mpFaktura supports fiscal printers and allows printing not only receipts but also invoices (if the printer has such a function). This is one of the few solutions that allows printed receipts on Maki. The program supports Posnet, Thermal, Novitus (Windows and OS X), Farex, Elzab (Windows only). Along with the application, we also receive an additional tool: BSX Printer. It is a print server that creates a lot of flexibility in handling fiscal devices in the company, and for Mac users, it gives the possibility to print receipts on unsupported Farex and Elzab printers (via a computer with Windows system).
 
 The application is available for Windows and OS X, and thanks to a flexible licensing model, it can be used on any supported system, under the same license. The program enables network operation - by many users at the same time. Its databases can be located on the same computer (built-in SQLite and Firebird database) or you can connect to any supported SQL database. mpFaktura supports databases: MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Firebird, Interbase, MS SQL (only in the Windows environment).
