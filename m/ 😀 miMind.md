miMind is a tool for mapping thoughts that prove extremely useful both during learning and planning various activities.

The program is available in the form of a clear and easy to use wizard that allows you to quickly prepare a mind map. Thanks to it, we will create it in just a few seconds, and when the need arises, we will properly expand the project by placing further clouds, lines and shapes (eg rectangles or circles) containing useful information.
 
 miMind contains several default templates (dark and light), and if the final look of the mind map does not meet our expectations, we can always change its graphic design. There is also an option to undo recently performed operations, thanks to which we can, for example, check whether the add-ons that we want to implement will match our work.
 
 It is worth adding that miMind allows you to export mind maps to graphic formats (JPEG / JPG, PNG, TGA, BMP), PDFs, text documents and XML files. We can also back up the project and store it on the internet.
