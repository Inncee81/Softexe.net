The program allows you to automatically register software and hardware, during which we will get a report not only about the installed programs in the computers available in our network and information about the current hardware configuration, but also check the history of changes made on the computer between audits (both software and hardware), we will get accurate information about the operating system, whether we will generate our own reports.
 
 MagikINFO has also been equipped with the function of managing licenses and the ability to perform bulk remote installations of programs, service packs, patches, and running scripts on multiple computers simultaneously. The license management module is responsible for displaying detailed information about the general licensing status of individual programs within the organization along with their location and immediate evaluation of which software is licensed and which is necessary for legalization or uninstallation.
