The program allows you to create backup copies of entire hard drives or selected partitions and save them in the indicated location - hard drive, local area network or CD / DVD. Work with it takes place through a wizard that guides you through the entire archiving process. Thanks to the use of the Microsoft Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS), Macrium Reflect can perform backups of the operating system, and the Rescue CD function allows its restoration to the indicated partition during eg a sudden failure.
 
 How to use the most important features of Macrium Reflect Free and make a Windows backup, you will learn from our guide .
 
 Noteworthy is the option of a work schedule that allows you to regularly create copies and overwrite an existing one. The created backup can optionally also be compressed.
 
 Macrium Reflect supports both internal and external hard drives (IDE, SATA, SCSI, USB, IEEE 1394 (FireWire)), as well as NTFS file systems (all versions), FAT16 / 32 and Ext2 / 3FS.
