This tool is addressed to fans of the classic who would like to recall the best games released on the iconic platform Nintendo, or the already mentioned NES (originally known in Japan under the name Famicon). Mesen supports not only the above-mentioned device, but also allows you to run games released on the Dendy console. The support of codes deserves attention, which may prove useful, as many older titles are characterized by a high level of difficulty.
  
 Mesen supports over 220 charters (all licensed productions are supported) and allows you to define numerous video filters, customize the color palette, and even set the image display method. It is also possible to record movies and sounds.
