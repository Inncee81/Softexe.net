Regardless of whether we accidentally removed the necessary documents or lost them as a result of media failure or virus attack, MaxDataGenius will allow us to easily and quickly restore the data. The supported file systems include: FAT12 / 16/32, exFAT, NTFS, CDFS / ISO9660, HFS +, ext2 / 3/4, ReiserFS, JFS, RAW, VMDK, ReFS and UFS / XFS / ZFS /.
 
 MaxDataGenius does not require any special knowledge on the part of the user. Thanks to the transparent wizard, we will be carried out by a step-by-step data recovery operation. We will indicate the volume to be scanned (it may be, for example, the selected partition on the hard disk, DVD drive or pendrive), the mode of operation (you can choose to search for deleted files or restore data from the partition that has been formatted), and then confirm your choices .
 
 This is not the end, because MaxDataGenius contains several additional functions. It is possible to restore data in a remote mode (by accessing the screen and keyboard), perform a hard disk analysis to detect various irregularities, create an HDD image (along with the restore function), directly copy the disk to disk, and reconstruct the RAID array.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to recover a maximum of 3 files.
