Tracks in this program are built of modules. You can use pre-produced melodies and combine with a bass backing or record your own vocal and instrumental sessions. You can also create live and improvise with Live-Pad mode, equipped with 30 sets of samples.
 
 
 The program includes 9 program instruments, a collection of sound effects and a tool for tuning the vocal track. There were also classic synthesizers like DN-1 or Revolta 2. You can also use Orange Vocoder ME in digital form.
 
 
 Professional mastering is possible, among others, thanks to a 6-band equalizer, which allows you to adjust each frequency range in detail. 
 
 
 The program can be tested for a week, and for free registration for 30 days.
