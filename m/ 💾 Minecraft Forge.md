> Minecraft Forge is a free tool that allows you to install modifications to the iconic Minecraft.

Using the described application, we not only fan the fan additions, but also we will be able to manage them from the main Minecraft Forge window. After launching Minecraft, installed mods will be available in a separate "mods" tab.
 
 Minecraft Forge was designed in such a way that installing mods for the game did not cause problems even to less experienced users (including children).
