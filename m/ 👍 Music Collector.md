Mucis Collector uses Discogs database and own resources to search for information about albums. Found you can manually supplement with missing information, you can also work offline and manually add all data. Entries can be supplemented with information about the condition of the media, price, store, date of purchase, location and so on. You can also add your own pictures of covers and discs.
 It is worth noting that for classical and orchestral music there is a separate form that allows you to complete information about the composer, conductor, orchestra, soloists and the like.
 
 
 The library can be searched and browsed in many ways, as a list, shelf, cover-flow style, divided into albums or as a song list. In the additional view, you can view the details of albums or statistics of the entire collection.
 
 
 The program in the demo version allows you to save a collection of up to 100 albums in one file. The database can be synchronized with the cloud (as well as with mobile applications) or kept only on the local disk. If the library is synchronized with the cloud, you can share it on the page.
