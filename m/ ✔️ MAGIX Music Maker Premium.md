MAGIX Music Maker offers a limited number of tracks on which you can place recordings, MIDI, samples, loops and parts played on virtual instruments. Access to instruments and samples is very easy thanks to the always visible library Mediapool with the ability to search and work in 7 keys.
 
 
 An interesting fact is the virtual instrument that allows you to record choirs in different keys using the keyboard. Of course, you can use the on-screen keyboard.
 
 
 The professional mixer allows the use of professional studio effects, as well as external plugs, compatible with the VST3 standard or Mastering Suite. There is also a 6-band equalizer and the possibility of stretching the sample over time and changing the frequency. There is also a Vocal Tune 2 tool that allows you to adjust the recordings in detail.
