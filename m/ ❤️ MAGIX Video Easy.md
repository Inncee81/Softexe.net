The program is very easy to use and many activities will help you create the wizards. It was created with the thought of beginning users, giving them the possibility of convenient assembly, without special knowledge. 
 
 
 Materials can be imported from a digital camera, smartphone, disk, and even an analog source (video recorder) if you can connect them to a computer. All popular codecs are supported, namely AVCHD, HDV, miniDV, MPEG, H.264, MKV, MOV, VOB, WMV, AVI and many more, as well as DVDs and Blu-ray discs. In addition to the ability to import video, MAGIX Video Easy also allows you to download photos and music that will serve as a background sound.
 
 In the program, we have the opportunity not only to assemble, but also to edit the supplied materials (brightness, contrast, saturation, speed of play and color tone), adding subtitles in different styles, recording your own voice as a narrative, as well as applying many video effects and animations. There are also those that stylize the project, for example an old movie. In addition, MAGIX Video Easy also offers tools to stabilize the image and shift the audio track relative to the video.
 
 The finished project can be saved to a disc or recorded on a DVD, AVHCD or Blu-ray disc, published on the Internet (on YouTube or MAGIX Online album) and sent to portable devices. In the case of burning on a medium it is possible to play it on many standard DVD and Blu-Ray players.Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 7 days. Free registration on the manufacturer's website allows you to extend this period to 30 days.
 
 The installation wizard suggests installing an additional toolbar and replacing the start page and the default search engine in your web browser. Deselecting the appropriate options, however, avoids installing these components.
 
 The program in the trial version allows you to export a maximum of 3 minutes of film.
