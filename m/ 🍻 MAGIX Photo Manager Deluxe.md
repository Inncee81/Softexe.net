In addition to extensive photo cataloging functions, the program also offers tools for basic photo processing. MAGIX Photo Manager Deluxe has been equipped with, among others tools for removing red eye, adding texts, rotating and scaling graphics, sharpening or correcting colors. All tools are very intuitive.
 
 Support for RAW files from digital cameras is also not a major problem for MAGIX Photo Manager Deluxe. The program is very good at importing photos from cameras from different manufacturers. In addition, photos can be instantly sent to the Flickr website or an attractive slideshow based on a photo catalog.
 
 Magix Photo Manager Deluxe also offers face recognition in pictures that automatically finds people and allows you to group photos by their faces. Of course, the photos can also be cataloged according to the time they were taken and places, if such data is available.
 
 
 Attention!
 During installation, the wizard proposes installing additional components. Deselecting the appropriate options avoids installing them in the system.
 
 The trial version allows you to use the program for 30 days (account registration required).
