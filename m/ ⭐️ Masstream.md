Masstream is a tool that allows you to convert any device into a portable multimedia server with the streaming function, thanks to which we will be able to manage files freely, as well as download them and share them with selected users.

After installing the software on a given hardware, it will serve as a tool for sending content via Wi-Fi. Using a home wireless network means that we can transfer large files easily and quickly. It is not without reason that the application allows you to download and send individual songs and entire libraries.
 
 Masstream is therefore an interesting alternative for people who do not exactly match what popular websites offer, such as eg Netflix, HBO GO, YouTube or many others. With our collection of films or other materials, we will be able to watch them in comfort without having to subscribe.
 
 Interestingly, in Masstream, we can activate the authentication function to prevent the use of our multimedia database to anonymous people.
