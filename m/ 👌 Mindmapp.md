The program has been equipped with a very simple interface, thanks to which we can focus all our attention on the created mind map. We will prepare it using the shared tools: we will be able to enter the text on previously loaded clouds (you can specify their size, displaying key information in this way), give it a selected font and color, and enrich your work with any pictures.
 
 Mindmapp allows you to save projects to * .mmap format. There is also the possibility to export them to a graphic file saved as * .jpg or * .png.
