Modelio has all the necessary tools for creating diagrams for systems, activities, use cases, states, interactions, classes, components, objects, implementations and the like. The program has a built-in auditor that will indicate errors, and the ability to export the model directly to the project class diagram in Java.  
 
 
 The program has the ability to import and export XML documents, as well as to prepare diagrams for publication in HMTL. You can use scripts in Jython to automate tasks. 
 
 
 Modelio supports UML2 with profiles for XSD, WSDL, BPEL, SoaML for modeling in distributed environments and BPMN for business processes. 
 
 
 Modelio has a lot of possibilities, which can be further expanded with community-created modules, free or paid. We will find, among others, support for TOGAF business process modeling, architecture modeling in SysML, MARTE for embedded systems and, of course, code generator in Java. Extensions can be viewed on the store's website .
