At first glance, the application has been created with a huge emphasis on simplicity and convenience of use. The graphical interface is available in the Polish language version and is characterized by minimalism and easy access to all offered functions. It has a standard window layout, in which its individual parts are responsible for displaying a list of supported mailboxes, e-mails and their contents. A great convenience when using Mailbird is support for keyboard shortcuts, streamlining the creation of new messages, responding to them, switching accounts / folders, etc. Also noteworthy is the function of speed reading, displaying the content of correspondence in the form of individual words / sentences. Its speed can be adjusted thanks to the appropriate option.
 
 Mailbird supports more than one e-mail account, allows convenient management of available folders within them (create and delete, synchronize), supports proxies, allows manual and automatic retrieval of e-mails, limiting the maximum size of attachments downloaded, and also can encrypt implemented within it, connections to the Network (SSL / TLS, STARTTLS). In addition, it also offers a set of mini-applications that allow you to use Google's calendar, Facebook account, Evernote services, Google Drive, Dropbox, as well as display content from lifehacker, TechCrunch etc.
 
 Attention!
 
 After installation, the program runs for 30 days as the 'Pro' edition, allowing the user to familiarize himself with the functions available only in a commercial application variation. After this test period, the program transforms into a limited, but free version of Mailbird.
