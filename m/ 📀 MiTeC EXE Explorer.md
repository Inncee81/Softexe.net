Using this software, we can read all the most important information and parameters of the EXE executable file, as well as conveniently review its internal structure. The program reads all information in executable files such as PE32 (Portable Executable), PE32 + (64-bit) and NE (Windows 3.x) and from files in virtual operating systems (VxD). 
 
 
 MiTeC EXE Explorer provides full information about the version of the executable file and also displays its hexadecimal content along with the Unicode / ASCII character strings. In addition, we can read metadata structures, sections, CLR streams, exceptions, units, forms, packages, flags and other elements of the executable file. 
 
 
 In addition, it has a convenient and clear resource browser that analyzes and displays all basic types of resources, and generates a detailed text report of the most important information about the executable file being viewed. Using the program we read the exact version of the file, the name of the program and the producer.
