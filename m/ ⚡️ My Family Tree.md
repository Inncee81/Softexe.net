The program, apart from the basic information about the person, ie the name, surname, date and place of birth, gives the opportunity to collect many other, often useful, data that characterize every human being. With the help of My Family Tree, we will also save information about social status, education, identification number, citizenship, profession, religious denomination, and even property, place of residence, baptism, retirement and many others. For users who do not have this information, the creators provide options for storing textual data (so-called stories), photos, audio and video files, as well as data on genetics.
 
 My Family Tree support is very simple, and the friendly and highly intuitive graphical interface supports this. The process of creating a new family tree starts with adding the profile of the selected person, completing its data, etc. The next step is only creating new profiles and establishing relationships between them. Among the available relationships we can find such as father, mother, brother, sister, spouse, son, daughter and unrelated. In the case of, for example, child profiles, the user can determine whether it was adopted, whether the parent was an adoptive parent, etc.
 
 Creating even complex family trees using My Family Tree is not so easy as it is also comfortable and enjoyable. The application gives you the opportunity to present all entered data, generate charts and statistics, as well as display the timeline. The program supports importing and exporting data in the GEDCOM format.Attention!
 Crack to the program is available in our section PROGRAMS -&gt; Extras -&gt; Polish locations (see: Related Programs).
