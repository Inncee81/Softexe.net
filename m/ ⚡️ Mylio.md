The application is very convenient to use and at the same time is characterized by high speed of operation even for larger libraries with photos. It offers almost all the necessary tools to easily organize family photo collections, etc. At the user's disposal was the ability to create albums from previously loaded image files, manage metadata stored in photos and search for individual copies on their basis. Mylio easily allows you to define people in the pictures and the location where they were taken. Of course, it is also possible to search albums based on these criteria.
 
 The Mylio program could not miss the photo editing and adjustment functions, and although these are basic options, in most cases it is sufficient to remove small imperfections of the photos. We find tools for managing white balance, exposure, contrast, brightness, shadows, etc., as well as an effective sharpening function.
 
 Attention!
 
 The application itself is free, however, its proper operation requires a user account. Free user account entitles you to operate up to 3 devices and 25 thousand. photography, and has limited photo editing capabilities (no brushes), does not store photos in the cloud, does not integrate with Lightroom and does not open RAWs.
