There are also many other administrative functions related to e-mail delivery, user authorization and server operation.
 
 The administration is very convenient and runs from the MMC console, and it is worth noting that MailEnable can authenticate users based on Active Directory. Starting from version 8, the server in the free version (Standard) offers IMAP support.
