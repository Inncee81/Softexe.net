The program is aimed at amateur electronics, who can easily and quickly calculate Fusebits for AVR microcontrollers using MkAvrCalculator (the authors have provided four different views), as well as program microcontrollers (MkAvrCalculator can function as a graphic overlay on the AVRDUDE program). In addition to the simplified mode, we can also find the full mode here, which makes MkAvrCalculator an interesting proposition for less and more experienced users.
 
 It is worth mentioning that during the work with MkAvrCalculator you do not have to worry about blocking the microcontroller. Although initially it may seem that the application is difficult to use, we are really dealing here with an intuitive tool. It allows you to read detailed information about a given microcontroller, modify its settings, add new options and more.
 
 MkAvrCalculator is available in both free and commercial versions. The free edition offers the support of the most popular microcontrollers: ATmega8, ATtiny2313, ATmega128 and ATmega162, and also gives the user access to all updates and full technical support.
