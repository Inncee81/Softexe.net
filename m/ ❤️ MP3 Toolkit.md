The program has been equipped with a modern mechanism for converting and unpacking multimedia files (audio and video) to MP3 format. Users can set the appropriate parameters in it before starting the processing. Among them we can find, among other things, the output format, bitrate, sampling frequency, audio channel and default directory in which the converted materials will be saved. 
 
 
 MP3 Toolkit also has the ability to rip audio CDs, record any sound using a microphone, and modify tags using a special editor. Thanks to it, we can also change the name of the album, track, album, year of production and enter even any comment. 
 
 
 In addition, the program allows you to combine and divide media files and allows you to merge several files in different formats into one large file with any extension. In addition, we will find in it another useful tool for cutting multimedia files into various parts, which can then be used to create ringtones for mobile phones.
