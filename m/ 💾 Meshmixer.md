> Meshmixer is a program for preparing ready-made 3D models for printing. The program can combine several models into one, design supports, apply texture surfaces and fine-tune the details before printing.

Models can be opened from the disk (in OBJ format), from the sample library or from the 123D cloud, and then arranged in the virtual chamber of the selected printer. They can also be resized to fit on the printing platform. 
 
 
 The editing tools allow you to sculpt the surface of the models with different brushes, transform them, combine them with the basic solids, reflect with the axis and cut into fragments. You can also cover the surface of the model with one of the available designs or stamp with shapes to make it more attractive. . 
 
 
 Preview models allows you to see what they will look like made of specific materials. The analysis tools will allow you to determine if the figure will be stable, how thick it will be, what size it will have, whether it will need props and whether the figure will not break. Before preparing models for printing, you can also generate necessary supports, close gaps and reduce sharp angles, which will increase the chances of correct printing.
 
 
 The prepared model can be exported in the following formats: STL, OBJ, DAE, PLY, AMF, WRL and SMESH. You can also send it to print in one of the external services or on an MakerBot, Stratasys, Dremel or Autodesk Ember printer.
