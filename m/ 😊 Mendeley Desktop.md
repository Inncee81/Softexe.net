> Mendeley Desktop is a powerful tool for organizing and managing various data stored on your computer. The application is also well-suited for working together with an appropriate scientific group, with which we will cooperate on a project for educational or business purposes.

The program is designed not only for students and students, but also for ordinary users who store important documents or other important data on the disk. Mendeley Desktop allows you to conveniently view, catalog and manage the right collection of materials, as well as create a bibliography and plan for work or school. It also allows you to generate a bibliography created by one person or an appropriate scientific group and place it on a blog or website. 
 
 
 One of the most important functions of the program is creating a bibliography and adding various footnotes using external text editors. The program has a special plugin that works with popular text editors (Microsoft Word 2003, 2007, 2010, etc.) and allows you to add bibliographies directly from the built-in Mendeley database without leaving or turning off the text program. 
 
 
 Mendeley Desktop streamlines the use and viewing of several different PDF documents at the same time, and also allows you to add different annotations directly to each PDF file. The program also allows you to backup data and put them on an external server (after logging in to your own account). In addition, it synchronizes the entire data library and allows them to be viewed on different mobile devices. The program has a simple and intuitive interface that allows you to view the created list of materials, add appropriate tags and enter other relevant information about a given document.
