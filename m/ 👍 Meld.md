```sh
Meld is a small application for comparing the content of text files and folder structures. The tool was created mainly for programmers who can control their projects in the next stages of development.

As in the case of other programs of this type, so in Meld the main program window has been divided into two parts - in each of them you can display a separate file to compare portions of the code or any other document. Optionally, you can also arrange up to three files side by side. It is worth noting that the tool also offers the function of merging documents, but the user has complete control over the introduced changes when performing this operation.  
 
 Numerous configuration options allow you to adjust the operation of Meld to the recipient's preferences. Comparing data may take place on specific rules (eg by omitting empty spaces in the text), and possible differences between documents are presented in the form of colored bars. However, when the files are identical, an appropriate message appears on the screen.
