The tool is characterized by a minimalist interface and simplicity of use. Musseks' tasks include mainly playing and stopping selected music. Thanks to the built-in search engine, we can quickly locate selected songs, play them or add them to the selected playlist.
 
 In addition to the name of each song, Museeks also displays detailed information about it in the form of a readable table. It contains the name of the artist or band, the album from which the song and genre are derived, provided that such data is obviously in the file owned by the user.
 
 Museeks offers the possibility of creating your own song library (the application supports the drag-and-drop technique), and then lets you add them to the selected playlist, which we can freely name.
