It is dedicated primarily to small retail and service companies whose activity does not require software that supports the warehouse. The program allows issuing all basic sales documents, keeping files of goods, services and contractors, and generating various types of statements and reports.
 
 The main advantages of the program is data storage technology based on the Microsoft SQL Server database (provided in the free version with the program) and the possibility of fiscalization of issued documents.
