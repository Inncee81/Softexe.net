> Mullvad is a small application for people who value privacy during everyday use of the Internet.

Thanks to this program, our network activity will be impossible to detect because it replaces the user's IP with another address. Mullvad is also worth installing if you do not want anyone to be able to determine our location. By launching the described tool, we become completely anonymous on the Internet, which means that not only can we feel safer, but also more comfortable. The end is even with personalized ads displayed based on the history of viewed web pages.
 
 Sometimes it happens that if you want to watch a movie on the internet, the message "the content is not available in your region" appears on the screen. Mullvad removes such a blockade, allowing you to read all the content published through the network.
 
 Mullvad is a tool that can be successfully used not only at home, but also by connecting to public wireless networks (eg in a hotel or cafe). 
 
 Attention!
 
 Mullvad requires the creation of a free user account. However, we do not have to provide login and password, but generate a special access code via the official application page.
