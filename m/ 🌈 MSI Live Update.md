The program allows you to work in two modes - automatic and manual, in which all components are automatically downloaded and installed on the computer, or the user decides what and when to install. In addition, MSI Live Update is equipped with task scheduling functions, which allows you to additionally automate the operation of the tool.
 
 MSI Live Update offers a polished and easy-to-use graphical interface, which in combination with the Polish language version allows the use of the tool also by less experienced users.
