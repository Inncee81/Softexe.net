The extension gives us the opportunity to define the default quality of the videos being played, to block any annotations and advertisements displayed on the screen while watching clips or to use a special Cinema mode in which the background is darkened. In addition, Magic Actions for YouTube allows you to disable the autoplay option, automatically repeat clips, control the volume with the mouse's sollar, and hide selected elements on YouTube pages. Thanks to it, we will also be able to use the buffering option while the video material is paused.
 
 Magic Actions for YouTube has been made available for Firefox, Google Chrome and Opera, with the option of importing / exporting configurations.
