Mobizen allows you to remotely manage your smartphone with the iOS or Android operating system from the computer using both a dedicated application and via a web browser.

Before using the Mobizen program, you must install it not only on your computer, but also your phone, by downloading the application from the Google Play Store or iTunes depending on your phone. Only then can we run the described tool on your mobile device and log in to your Google or Facebook account or alternatively create a new one. After doing this, you must select the device type and follow the instructions on the screen.
 
 All operations performed on the computer with Mobizen are automatically visible on the screen of the mobile device (and vice versa). This is much more convenient than "wrestling" with the touch screen. Especially if we have an urgent task to do or we have to deal with a large number of operations (eg manually removing unnecessary files). The application is worth using when you want to show your friends photos or videos on the big screen without having to copy them to your computer's hard drive.
 
 Mobizen offers the possibility of working after connecting the phone with a USB cable, but it can also work wirelessly (in the paid version Pro). 
 
 attention
 
 The free version allows you to connect your computer to a portable device only via a USB cable. It is possible to use the 6-day trial period in which the wireless option is unlocked.
