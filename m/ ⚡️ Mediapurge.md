MediaPurge is a free application that offers tools that allow you to manage your own multimedia library.

The tool allows you to find duplicate files thanks to the option of comparing two media based on size and tags. But that's not all, because MediaPurge can automatically edit, copy or delete ID3 tags, rename files based on tags or generate and assign tags with its name.
 
 MediaPurge is also used to quickly organize your music collection. The program copes well with the work using the available file and tag names to create new folders with them, and then sort them accordingly. In case we already have our collections, we can compare and synchronize them (eg to remove duplicates).
 
 Using MediaPurge is very simple, because the whole is based on the creator, so you do not have to look for the necessary options, but simply select the necessary functions from the list on the screen, and then go to the next stage of work.
