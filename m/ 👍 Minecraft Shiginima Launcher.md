The tool is very easy to use and available in the Polish language version (required configuration in the program options). After launching, create a player profile, and then download and install the selected Minecraft editions. Shiginima Launcher allows you to install more than one edition of the game and supports versions from 1.0 to the latest 1.12.2. Interestingly, it also gives access to experimental versions (so-called snapshots) and old Beta and Alpha test editions.
 
 However, this is not the end of the possibility of this small launcher. It has been equipped with the functions of installing the game in any user-defined location, running the game in the indicated resolution and the version of the JRE, as well as adding arguments for the JVM.
 
 Shiginima Launcher was created in Java and requires Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to run. It is available for Windows, Linux and Mac OS.
