The program is characterized by a clear and intuitive graphical interface and speed of action, which is the effect of support for hardware acceleration and nVidia CUDA technology. It allows you to play movies in high definition without losing image quality and keeping all available audio tracks (DTS HD Master Audio, Dolby TrueHD audio, etc.). Mac Blu-ray Player also supports the DTS 5.1 standard, ensuring high quality of the sound being played.
 
 The player has been equipped with most of the functions necessary to conveniently play movies on the computer. Among them we can find a full menu service, available on Blu-ray, DVD or Video-CD carriers, the ability to play movies directly from ISO disc images and streams made available via the Internet, displaying subtitles, handling chapters and multiple audio tracks. The user can also easily share information about the videos they watch on their profile on Facebook and Twitter. From the level of the program we can easily create and save on the disk screenshots of the video being played.
 
 Mac Blu-ray Player supports multimedia files in MOV, MKV, AVI, FLV, WMV, MP4, MPEG, RMVB, MP3, WMA, AAC, AC3 and many other formats. The player's appearance can be adapted to individual preferences thanks to the support of graphic motifs.
