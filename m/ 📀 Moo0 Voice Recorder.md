The program allows you to work in as many as 3 different modes - Any PC Sound, Any PC Sound and Voice and Only Voice, which give you the ability to record sounds from your computer, computer sound and microphone signal, as well as only from a microphone. The captured audio track can be saved as MP3 or WAV files in quality from 32 to 320 kbps.
 
 Moo0 Voice Recorder, despite its small size, offers features that go far beyond the system sound recorder. The application, besides the ability to record conversations using voice messengers, also allows you to record sound from any Internet streams or during karaoke (voice from microphone + background audio) etc. The appropriate configuration allows you to start the process of recording the sound at the selected time or when our microphone will register any sound ('Cut Silence' option).
 
 Among the features offered, one also needs to mention the support of keyboard shortcuts and graphic themes, allowing to customize the appearance of the application to the individual preferences of the user.
