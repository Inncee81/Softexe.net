Using the tool itself should not cause problems. MediBang Paint Pro makes it easy to create comic frames and draw any characters or objects in them using available components (brushes, erasers, gradient editor, filling tools, etc.). The program contains over 700 various extras to be used while working on your creation.
 
 At the very beginning, MediBang Paint Pro intimidates the number of options available, but the modern user interface, despite the fact that the product is highly developed, is extremely transparent and easy to use. In several respects, it raises associations with the most popular commercial graphic editor, i.e. Adobe Photoshop.
 
 MediBang Paint Pro allows you to edit several files at once and work on layers; it also allows you to work on several graphics on one project at the same time. If we already have ready fragments that we would like to place in it, we can import them from MangaName.  
 
 Do not worry - the authors of MediBang Paint Pro also took care of the user's safety. The tool uses the "cloud", so you can quickly back up your image files.
