The program allows you to manage such elements of the phone as SMSes (incoming, sent, drafts), address book, contact profiles, organizer, calendar, alarms, data stored on the SIM card, etc. Through the MyPhoneExplorer the user also has the option of transferring files from a computer disk to phone and monitoring the device's memory status. In addition, the application provides such information about the phone as the IMEI number, model, software version, signal quality, battery temperature, current consumption or charging voltage.
 
 Sony Ericsson and other Android phones can be operated via a USB cable, a Bluetooth connection or a COM port.
