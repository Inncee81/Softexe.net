Microsoft Edge is a new edition of the browser known from Windows 10. This time Microsoft has put on the Chromium engine, significantly changing the functionality of the program and the possibilities of its personalization. In this way, the manufacturer wants to meet the expectations of users and compete for shares in the browser market, which is dominated by people using Google Chrome.

Supporting the new Edge should not be a challenge for anyone who has previously had contact with Google Chrome. The layout of the elements on the bar is very similar, and the settings are grouped according to similar criteria, although their appearance and method of selecting the category is slightly different.
 
 The new Edge supports extensions, proposes several home page display modes and, at first glance, works more efficiently than its predecessor with the EdgeHTML engine.
