The program was originally created to enable players to save the world from older editions and transfer it to a newer version of the game. Since then, the developers have developed MCEdit with many tools that allow you to conveniently manipulate many aspects of the virtual world of the game. The user has options for selecting selected elements, their transfer, cloning, changing colors and shape. The tool allows you to move around the map and offers a two-, three-dimensional view and a bird's eye view.
