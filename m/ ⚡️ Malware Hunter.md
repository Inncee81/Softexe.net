A key option available in Malware Hunter is scanning the computer's hard drive to find various files that could harm the privacy of the user and infect the operating system. Scanning can be carried out in one of three variants: fast, full or non-standard, which allows you to check specific folders or files (eg after downloading them from the Internet).
 
 The tool offers the possibility of optimizing the operation of the operating system and internet connection by turning off unnecessary applications (eg those starting together with popular "windows") and network functions that we do not use on a daily basis. 
 
 Malware Hunter is characterized by a modern and very clear user interface. Individual options have been divided into tabs visible in the left part of the screen, while access to specific services is available by clicking on the icon on the right side of the application window.
