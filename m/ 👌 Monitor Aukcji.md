The principle of operation and the purpose of the program is very simple. It deletes the user on cyclical searches of the occasion, checking every freely defined period (eg every 1 minute) or no auctions appeared in the categories selected by us. If you find an advert that meets the criteria, we are immediately informed about it. The Auction Monitor allows you to easily define the search (eg by entering a department or word in the content) or advanced, by specifying, for example, the location, price, status of the item, etc.
 
 The application after running works all the time in the background, does not burden the work of the computer, just specify the criteria and hide the program.
 
 Additional program options
 choosing the search category from the wizard (olx and ebay)
 blocking users: we define user logins whose listings are skipped in searches
 checking prices in the ceneo, google and nickname websites
 presenting the auctions in defined tabs, previewing the content in the program
 search for similar listings in completed
 Export and import of search categories
 
 Attention!
 
 Auction Monitor is available in the free version LITE, which however has limitations and allows you to familiarize yourself with the possibilities of the program. In addition, the manufacturer provides the application in paid varieties STANDARD (PLN 9 / month) and the richest PRO (PLN 19 / month).
