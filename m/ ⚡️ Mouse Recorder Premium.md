The program has two recording modes for the corresponding sequences that can be mixed with each other. The first consists in registering activities that the user performs, using the keyboard and mouse as a standard. The second option is to create a suitable "dry" scenario, directly in the application window, selecting the next elements from the ribbon. The previously recorded macros can also be edited in the same way.
 
 The application, of course, allows you to save your scenarios. During playback, we have the ability to choose the speed of replication of user's movements and the number of repetitions of the entire loop, practically to an unlimited extent.
