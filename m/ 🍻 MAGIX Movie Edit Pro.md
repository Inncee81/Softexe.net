Movie Edit Pro primarily allows you to easily import material from any source. Laying the fragments in the right order can be done in two ways on a detailed timeline with 32 tracks, or in the Storyboard, where you can see the thumbnails of the clips. 
 
 
 The program perfectly copes with 4K materials and allows you to conveniently combine videos, photos and background music with effects, subtitles and transitions. There was also the possibility of using the shots recorded on Greenscreen. The program also gives the possibility of automatic optimization and automatic editing of clips as well as image stabilization.
 
 
 The film can be sent directly to the Vimeo website. You can also use special effects available in the store. 
 
 
 The program can be tested for one week and after 30 days for free registration.
