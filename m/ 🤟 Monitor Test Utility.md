The application offers two modes of operation, during which we will check whether our monitor correctly displays individual colors and objects. Before this happens, the Monitor Test Utility will generate a list of connected devices and will also allow you to choose from many available screen resolutions. Only after doing this will we decide whether the test is to display various static charts or moving objects.
 
 Interestingly, Monitor Test Utility also provides detailed information about the monitor. Speech of diagonal, number of colors, resolution, aspect ratio and refresh rate.
 
 Monitor Test Utility does not require specialized knowledge on the part of the user. Noteworthy is also a very transparent, minimalist interface. These features make the tool described targeted at all people who want to check the operation of their monitor.
