Metalith is a very easy-to-use metadata editor that allows you to work on multiple files at the same time (processing of entire directories).

Browsing, analyzing, modifying, deleting, creating and displaying tag descriptions - Metalith offers everything necessary when working on metadata. It also allows you to edit two files for comparison purposes, copy data and tags from one file to another. Noteworthy is also the function of synchronizing data contained in two identical tags of one file.
 
 Among the file formats supported by Metalith we find mainly: TIFF, Exif, IPTC and XMP. In addition, the tool copes well with the support of graphic images saved as TIFF or JPEG (they can be presented in full screen or in the form of thumbnails), as well as creating charts for individual tags.
 
 Metalith also includes the function of creating reports of completed works that we can save to HTML, XML or TIFF files. You can also view them on full screen or print.
