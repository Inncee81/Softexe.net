The program allows you to recover the username and password that we defined in the mail client to log in to our mailbox, provided that we selected the option to remember the password during authentication on the mail server. In this case, the said data is stored locally in the system registry as encrypted strings, and the Mail Password Decryptor allows you to decrypt and read them.
 
 The tool can restore passwords for all mailboxes configured in the client and supports applications such as Microsoft Outlook Express, Microsoft Outlook (2002 / XP / 2003/2007/2010/2013), Mozilla Thunderbird, Windows Live Mail 2012, IncrediMail, Foxmail (6. x - 7.x), Windows Live Messenger, MSN Messenger, GTalk, GMail Notifier, PaltalkScene IM, Pidgin, Miranda and Windows Credential Manager. The recovered information can be saved to the disk as a text file, HTML or XML file.
 
 Attention!
 
 Due to the functionality offered by the tool, it can be detected by antivirus software as potentially harmful and threatening our security, but it is in fact completely safe.
 The program installation wizard offers you the option of installing additional components, but you can omit this operation by clicking on the 'Decline' option.
