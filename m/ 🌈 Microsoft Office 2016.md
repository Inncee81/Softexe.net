 News and changes in the 2016 version
 
 The latest edition brings a lot more interesting things for the end user than the previous one, prepared mainly for corporate administrators and programmers. First of all, Office 2016 applications have direct access to files in the OneDrive cloud - we can create, open, edit and save documents from their level. At the same time, the improvements in Outlook are intended to help you attach such Office documents and configure permissions to access them.
 
 Microsoft also boasts brilliant tools that allow people to get more out of the Office than it has been possible so far. The Tell Me search engine will help in this, thanks to which we will find out what command to use, writing what we want to do, Insights, which looks for contextual information from the Web for selected fragments of content, and Clutter, managing filtering and organizing Outlook inbox based on the user's tendencies.
 
 Excel 2016 is to be the basic tool for analysts, thanks to functions such as automatic creation of forecasts from available data strings or intuitive merging and shaping data sources (not only simple tables, but also sources from SAP client or unstructured data from non-relational database Hadoop). Improved pivot tables will allow you to build data models, automatic grouping, or intuitive analysis on tables of up to hundreds of millions of rows. The obtained results will be able to be visually presented in numerous new forms of graphs and charts.
 
 Administrators also have a reason to become interested in the new Office 2016 (in the Enterprise version). They get new security mechanisms and control of users' work (including the ability to remotely enforce and enforce policies for creating and sharing content, managing rights and access to information for Visio diagrams), and can enable multicomponent authentication in Outlook. They also get tools for better network traffic management (it will be possible to prioritize and throttle traffic), easier to install patches for the Office suite, and more easily manage the activation of access to Office 365.
 
 Attention!
 
 The trial version allows you to use the Office suite for 30 days. To activate the product, use the NKGG6-WBPCC-HXWMY-6DQGJ-CPQVG key .
