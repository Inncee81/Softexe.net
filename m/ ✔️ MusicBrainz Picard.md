Picard is an advanced program for editing metadata (id3 tags and other) music files. Its basic task is to retrieve information about music from the MusicBrainz website, of which it is an official "client".

Picard is not one of the simplest to use programs, but it perfectly copes with the recognition of music files and finding the right tags for them in the MusicBrainz database. To download tags for your songs, you need to load them into the list (as individual files or entire folders). The list of files is in the left panel of the program. Then the selected files should be identified, what are the "check" options (reading the metadata currently saved in the file) and "search" (searching the MusicBrainz database).
 
 For identification, Picard uses fingerprint music (PUID). Identified songs are transferred to the right program panel, where they can be grouped to performers, albums or songs. There you can also choose the version and edition of the album, edit the tags manually and save the information to a file. In addition, Picard automatically identifies CDs and provides cover management tools.
 
 The program can be expanded using plugins written in Python. Useful add-ons, such as searching through additional pages or downloading specific tags, can be found on the project website . There is also a short instruction manual for the program.
