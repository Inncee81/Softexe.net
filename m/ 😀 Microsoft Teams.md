Microsoft Teams not only allows you to send messages to all members of a team. We can also set up threads to share information with selected users, and even to talk to individual people individually. In addition to the text chat option, the tool enables video conferencing, which you can join not only when you start Microsoft Teams on your computer, but also on your mobile device or in the Skype Room system.
 
 It is worth mentioning that Microsoft Teams not only offers the possibility to share files, but also has built-in programs included in the Office 365 service. This means that during work, we will use, among others, such tools as: SharePoint, OneNote and Planner, as well as services Power BI.
