The described software has been made available in the form of a bootable ISO disk image, which should be placed on a USB stick (eg using the Rufus tool ), and then the computer should be started via it. MediCat USB allows the user to run a special edition of Windows 10, in which specialized tools designed to remove many problems with the operating system have been installed.
 
 Thanks to them, we will scan the computer for all types of viruses that we will remove efficiently if detected. Going further, the user gets the functions that enable backup data from disks, command prompt, device manager and user password reset option. Importantly, MediCat USB also allows you to run a special release of the Lubuntu operating system.
