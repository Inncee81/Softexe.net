Audio sounds can be recorded while playing along with previously recorded songs, while MIDI can be saved using the MIDI keyboard (optionally a computer keyboard or touch screen). The editing includes the possibility of removing incorrect fragments of songs (audio and MIDI), and additionally, the user can make use of the sound mixing function. The tool supports ASIO drivers, VST plugins and DirectX libraries.
 
 MultitrackStudio provides virtual instruments. The sounds of MIDI instruments can be recorded using the MultitrackStudio Lite and the vocal tracks of the songs. Interestingly, the described application also allows you to save individual projects and mix all songs in one sound file, and then burn them to a CD.
