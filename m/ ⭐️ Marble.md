The program is an excellent alternative to Google Earth . It allows you to display three-dimensional models in as many as 10 different themes (views) - including using maps OpenStreetMap, satellite model, historical model, atlas, maps including temperature in summer and winter, etc. Marble gives the possibility of projection of maps in the form of a globe, a standard (flat) map and the so-called Transverse Mercator.
 
 With the help of the program, we can easily search for the indicated places and points on the maps, as well as access to many useful information about them, including materials on Wikipedia. In addition, Marble offers features to route between two points, between which we will travel by car, bike or on foot. The tool also allows you to display a number of other information on the map, i.e. the shadow of the sun, data about where the sun is at the zenith, etc.
