MechWarrior Online is a network version of a well-known series of the same title that drew inspiration from the popular board game BattleTech. Thanks to the cooperation of the renowned studio Piranha Bytes with the owners of the rights to the brand, amazing production in the Free-2-Play model was successfully created, where the player once again sits behind the controls of huge rolling machines. These are so-called BattleMechs, heavy armored and armored robots weighing from 20 to 100 tons driven by individual pilots.

The machines are available in four classes, from fast, light and agile to slow, a bit heavy, but with a staggering firepower and huge destructive abilities. Each category of mechs can be modified by adjusting it to various combat systems consisting of a specific type of rockets and electronics supporting pilots in combat.
 
 The game is based on the struggle of teams, and each winning match is awarded with a special currency introduced into the game, ie C-Billami. Additional experience points are also awarded for winning battles.
 
 A team of several players, in order to emerge victorious from the struggle with the opponent, must demonstrate unbelievable mixing and knowledge of the possessed equipment. Each machine, depending on its class, is useful and checks best in specific applications. For example, the quick ones deal with the diagnosis by informing the impact force about the weaknesses of the enemy. In practice, it looks like the players participating in the direct fight are supported by the second line usually with the help of sniper departments.
 
 In addition, the game offers a test arena, where you can learn to operate the mecha and test its capabilities both in close combat with the living enemy and when acquiring selected points on the map.
 
 MechWarrior Online is an interesting item that requires a lot of cooperation and fighting skills in the team. The ability to compete with other players, the systematic expansion of your own arsenal and the system of promotions make the game can be drawn for a very long time.
