The MakeMKV program converts all types of AVCHD, DVD, HD DVD and Blu-ray movies to MKV format, while maintaining the highest image quality and the original HD audio track. In addition, all necessary data on chapters and meta information will be preserved, including but not limited to the type of audio and language paths. 
 
 
 The process of converting a movie to MKV format takes place in three different stages - mounting the disc to an optical drive and reading its contents, editing individual parameters of the film and removing unnecessary languages ​​and the data conversion process itself, which can take up to several minutes in the case of ripping a DVD movie.
