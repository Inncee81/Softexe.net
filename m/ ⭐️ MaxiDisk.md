The program, like other solutions of this manufacturer, offers a polished and very user-friendly graphical interface in which we can easily find individual functions. With its help, we can efficiently and in detail scan the entire contents of the disk and find out what percentage of the data is fragmented and whether there are unnecessary data among them that can be deleted to recover free disk space.
 
 MaxiDisk, despite its apparent simplicity, is an effective and safe tool. It allows you to defragment the contents of the disk, delete unnecessary data - junk, backups, temporary files of the web browser, etc., as well as compress large files to recover additional disk space. The work of the program can be automated thanks to the task scheduler function, enabling planning of future defragmentation and cleaning of hard disks in the computer.
