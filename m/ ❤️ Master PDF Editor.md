It offers a set of functions that allow even an inexperienced user to efficiently create various types of documents. With their help, we will add not only text, but also graphics, links and comments to the project, as well as such interactive components as text boxes, check boxes or option lists. For each of these elements, we can define many parameters, i.e. size, color, whether they should be taken into account during printing, etc.
 
 Master PDF Editor can be successfully used to convert documents between PDF and XPS formats. The program also allows you to export selected pages to graphic files (BMP, JEPG, PNG, TIFF) and to secure PDF files with a 128-bit encryption algorithm.Attention!
 
 The trial version of the program adds a small watermark to the PDF documents you create.
