In the program, the user has a total of 99 multimedia paths to which projects can be applied. Video and sound from the same source are arranged on one path, thus saving space. In addition, the program identically treats materials from various types of cameras and allows you to save the project in a single format. Multicam mode allows you to combine recordings from up to four cameras and automatically adjust them based on soundtracks. For each of them, the program has mechanisms to remove distortions of the lens with image stabilization.
 
 
 The shots can be cut in many ways, dividing them into parts, removing the beginning or the end. In addition, the program can automatically adjust the volume of subsequent shots and build a 5.1 soundtrack, and thanks to Music Editor 3.0 also refresh the old recordings. 
 
 
 
 The finished films can be saved on a DVD, AVHCD and Blu-ray disc with the appropriate menu and graphics, save as a file, prepare a 3D projection film or send a movie straight to your favorite website, like YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook, showfly or MAGIX Online Album. The program can work with 4K and XAVCS materials from professional cameras.
