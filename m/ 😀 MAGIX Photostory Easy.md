The program has the ability to import photos and videos from any media and automatically sets them on the timeline according to the file name. The user can decide on the time of visibility of each photo, improve its colors, layout and add effects or subtitles. You can also use the transitions between photos and record a comment for each of them. To make it faster, the machine will ensure that each picture fills the screen.
 
 The show can of course have its own music, headlines and end credits. At any moment, you can turn on the show in full screen. 
 
 MAGIX Photostory Easy can be tested for 7 days and after 30 days for free registration. The video export is limited to 3 minutes in the trial version.
