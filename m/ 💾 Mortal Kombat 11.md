Classic game mechanics
 
 Even if the last time we dealt with Mortal Kombat in childhood, by starting the newest part we will feel at home immediately, because the main assumptions have not changed in recent years. There are two warriors facing each other and we, as one of them, must defeat their enemy in a duel of up to three rounds. At the end of course you can not miss the well-known "Finish him!".
 
 Famous faces, new heroes
 
 Mortal Kombat 11 offers many playable characters. Baraka, Raiden, Skarlet, Scorpion, Sonya Blade, Sub-Zero are examples of well-known heroes, but new warriors appear alongside them, including a powerful and loyal servant of the Chronicle named Geras, whose greatest asset is the ability to control time.
 
 Story mode
 
 For many players, the essence of the game in Mortal Kombat 11 will be multiplayer, but one can not forget about the available campaign, in which we will follow a completely new story. The theme of the story is the manipulation of time. For the needs of the game, other game variants and additional challenges have been developed, the completion of which allows you to unlock interesting prizes.
