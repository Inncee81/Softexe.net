MailStore Home is an interesting and free (for home use) tool that allows you to archive e-mail coming from many sources in the form of one file stored on your hard disk, CD / DVD or portable USB memory.

The program supports the majority of the most popular e-mail clients - including Microsoft Outlook 2000 / XP / 2003/2007/2010 Beta, Outlook Express, Windows Mail, Mozilla Tunderbird and SeaMonkey, as well as services - including GMail and IMAP / POP3 protocols. Any archived mail can be browsed and searched (which is important without having to unpack the archive). The data collected in this way can be saved via the built-in CD / DVD creator. In addition to importing mail, MailStore Home also allows its export. And here the most popular e-mail applications are supported, as well as IMAP mailboxes, etc.
 
 An unquestionable advantage of the program is enormous simplicity and a friendly and pleasing graphic interface. However, there is no task scheduling function that allows you to define automatic archiving at a specific time.
