Machinery Natural HDR is a program designed to create specific HDR images. As the name of the program suggests, these images are "natural", i.e. they resemble what the human eye sees. The algorithms used in the program try to combine the appropriate fragments of photos to get a well-lit scene, which allows you to avoid unnatural glow and exaggerated edges.
