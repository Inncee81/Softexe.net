The program, despite the lack of a Polish language version, is an interesting proposition for less experienced users who would like to avoid a sudden loss of valuable data. The backup operation in the simplest form is based on defining the data source as well as the location where the disk image should be saved. MiniTool ShadowMaker allows you to copy data only from used sectors and sector by sector, to divide large image files into several smaller ones, compress created backups, add comments to them, secure with a password, and automatically shut down the computer after work.
 
 MiniTool ShadowMaker Free gives you the ability to create bootable media based on WinPE, offers the ability to clone disks, work according to the task schedule, and supports HDD, SDD, USB, NAS etc., based on the exFAT, FAT16, FAT32 file system, NTFS and Ext2 / 3/4.
