Metastream allows you to organize joint online sessions, where together with other users we will watch movies or listen to music shared on the web.

During the creation of the session, we can immediately invite other users to watch the movie, TV series, program or live stream we selected, as well as listen to music by sending them a special code generated by the application. If, however, we receive the invitation ourselves, we will have to copy the received string after selecting the function of joining the session. During the screening there is an option to comment on events in a special chat.
 
 Metastream supports the most popular websites, such as: YouTube, Twitch, SoundCloud, Netflix, Hulu, and Reddit. Nothing prevents you from searching for material from another source by running Google search.
