The program identifies each of the sound files loaded by the user with the use of advanced technology that allows recognizing even less popular songs. After completing this process, Music Tag downloads information about individual songs from over 35 million database items and saves them in each of the files. Among the data completed by the application you will find, among others the title of the song, its performer, the name of the album, the type of music, date of creation, track number and disc and cover. Text information can be modified by the user. Similarly, in the case of the cover, the application gives the user the opportunity to choose one of the proposals offered or to load graphics from a computer disk.
 
 Music Tag supports a "drag-and-drop" mechanism that allows you to easily and conveniently load many files located in different places in the program. We can load single tracks, as well as even large folders that gather music. The program supports audio files in MP3, M4A and WMA formats.
