The program is worth using when you suspect that your PC's hard drive has malware. During the scan, the tool connects to the File Reputatio McAfee Global Threat Intelligence (GTI) database to locate unwanted files. Importantly, the user does not need to have specialist knowledge, because the use of the application is extremely simple and largely based on the click of a button.
