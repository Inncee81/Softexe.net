> My Summer Car is an extensive simulator of the independent Amistech Games studio, thanks to which we can build our own car using hundreds of available parts.

However, this is not the end of fun, because in My Summer Car an advanced driving model is available, as a result of which we can test our car on the road. Contrary to what the name suggests, the described production also provides many other means of transport, such as for example boats, which we can control. "DÅ‚ubanie" under the hood is obviously not everything that My Summer Car has to offer, because the creators have also prepared other attractions, including even the possibility of bathing in the sauna.
 
 My Summer Car allows players to experience the Finnish climate from the end of the 20th century. Enjoying the amazing of that period, we will build, repair, improve and modify various vehicles. Next, we will sit behind the wheel to take care of the various jobs to earn money. We will allocate cash for the purchase of new parts, thanks to which we will design, for example, our own rally car. However, we do not have to limit ourselves to regular tuning, because we can convert the car into a driving disco.
 
 When starting your adventure with My Summer Car it is worth bearing in mind that the game offers a permanent death system. If the character we drive dies in the course of the game, we will lose all progress and we will not be able to continue playing.
