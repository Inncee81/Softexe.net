Thanks to this program, we will be able to organize your time easily and quickly by introducing various information to the desktop calendar. MineTime works with the most popular services, so we can import data from Google Calendar, Outlook, Microsoft Exchange, iCloud and any service using CalDAV.
 
 MineTime will inform the user about the ways of spending time (for example, talking about meetings with friends), as well as his / her obligations (for example, it will display details about appointments that have been finally postponed). In addition, a special chart will show us the level of intensity of duties in a selected period, which may also be extremely useful when planning subsequent activities.
 
 MineTime is characterized by a simple, even minimal user interface. We can display individual days, weeks or months in it. In addition, the tab allows you to manage your contacts.
