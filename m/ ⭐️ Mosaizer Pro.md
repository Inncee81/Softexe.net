Mosaizer Pro is a free graphic tool designed to build mosaics from properly selected and arranged photos. The program is based on sophisticated and fast algorithms, giving the possibility of effectively mounting the indicated image from a set of many appropriately reduced images.

Work with the program takes place using a simple wizard that guides the user through all stages of building the mosaic. In the next 3 steps you should define the standard image, the size of individual "tiles" and their number in the level, as well as optionally tune the basic parameters of the source image.
 
 The application supports graphic files in BMP, JPG and PNG formats.
