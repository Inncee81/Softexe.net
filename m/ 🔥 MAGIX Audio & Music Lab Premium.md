MAGIX Audio &amp; Music Lab Premium allows you to work with audio sampled at 96 kHz and saved with a depth of 24 bits. All imperfections and distortions can be removed with the help of professional tools that allow to get rid of background noise, interference generated by the equipment, and to a large extent the defects of analog media. The program is ideal for raising the quality of film recordings from amateur cameras or smartphones. There are several dozen sound optimization schemes for different situations. 
 
 
 Sound recordings can be mounted on four tracks, also by editing selected ranges. There was no possibility of stretching the sounds in time without changing the tone, as well as changing the frequency. The zplane mechanism, considered to be the best in this industry, is responsible for this. 
 
 
 Interestingly, the program included a search engine for radio stations, broadcasting interesting music and programs presenting artists from around the world. The finished recordings can be immediately published on SoundCloud, YouTube and Facebook.
 
 
 The program works for 7 days in the trial version. This time can be extended up to 30 days after free registration.
