The strong point of the program is the numerous thematic settings that allow you to professionally clean the recordings and bring out the best sound. There are almost 300 settings here that allow you to remove background noises, taps, pops, wind blowing in the microphone and other similar sounds. In addition, the sound can be optimized for a particular musical genre, narration or surroundings.
 The program can also be used for basic editing of recordings. You can trim them, adjust the volume, remove distortion and export in the selected format. 
 
 
 The program also allows you to import the contents of CDs to a computer. Finished recordings can be covered with a cover and metadata. 
 
 
 The trial version of the program works for 7 days. You can extend this period to 30 days with free registration.
