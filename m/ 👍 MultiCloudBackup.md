The application is available for free and offers several useful options, apart from creating backups and sending them to various services or servers. During the first launch of the program, we must select the password that we will protect our files. The next step is to choose the service provider - we can choose from local backup and Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, hubiC and SMB. In the future, the creators want to integrate with other disk space providers in the network.
 
 The next step is of course defining the folders and files that we want to further protect. By default, the program performs automatic data backup every 2 hours, but we can change these settings at any time. We can also choose that MultiCloudBackup will ignore files larger than the specified size, which will protect us from using the entire available plan in the given service. The program also has the option of storing all backups, or removing the older ones. Added to this is the encryption function of transmitted data and the restoration of selected files to the hard disk.
