MiKTeX is a set of tools for the submission of text, in particular, mathematical and scientific records. Programs included in the package are the implementation of TeX and LaTeX systems for Windows.

MiKTeX contains everything you need to submit text in LaTeX or TeX language and to generate documents. There are styles, fonts and compiled programs that will help in publishing.
 
 It must be remembered that TeX is a WYSIWYM system, i.e. based on directives and tags, so we will not find an editor here that allows you to view the appearance of documents. The preview provides the Yap program, compiling and displaying the document on a current basis. There is also a TeXWorks editor here that highlights the syntax and presents the file compilation result. It's worth starting work with him. It is also worth mentioning a small program that allows you to nest MiKTeX on the taskbar, from where you can quickly run basic functions.
 
 
 Another advantage of the MiKTeX package is the ability to easily install and download missing packages. This can be done using the directive \usepackage{nazwa}, giving the name of the package you need. It is also possible to download missing elements automatically at the installation. The repository is regularly updated, so there should be no problems with the availability of new versions.
