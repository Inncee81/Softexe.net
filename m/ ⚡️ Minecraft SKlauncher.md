> SKlauncher is an unofficial launcher for Minecraft, which, unlike the original, allows you to install and run more than one version of the game on your computer. It also allows you to customize many game parameters to your individual preferences.

The tool after running requires creating a user profile within which selected editions of the game will be installed. SKlauncher supports Minecraft releases from 1.0 to the latest 1.12.2. Optionally, the user may also install experimental versions (so-called snapshots), alpha (from 2010) and beta (breakthrough 2010-2011).
 
 SKlauncher also allows you to create any number of player profiles, define the location of the game, resolution and select the location with the required component to run javaw.exe and add arguments for JVM.
