Transparent interface
 
 Individual issues provided in the Multimedia Codex have been divided into various categories (eg general rules, pedestrian traffic, vehicle traffic, traffic order and road safety or vehicles), which are available in the main menu level. Therefore, we can choose from which department we want to learn, improve or expand our knowledge.
 
 Traffic rules
 
 Although the quality of graphic materials leaves much to be desired, the Multimedia Codex contains a lot of valuable news, which we can read by reading the boards on the screen and listening to the voice of a teacher accompanying us during learning.
 
 Current traffic regulations
 
 It is worth noting that the Multimedia Code contains detailed information on traffic regulations from 2019.

 The perfect app for those preparing for the driving test
