The program can recover lost or forgotten passwords securing access to ZIP files using three different methods - brute-force, attack with the use of a mask and a dictionary. Perfectly deals with archives created using such applications as WinZip , PKZip, WinRAR , 7-Zip and many others, and supports default encryption standards for ZIP and ZIPX formats. The advantage of the tool is additional support for hardware acceleration through modern NVIDIA and AMD graphics cards, which allows you to speed up the process of password recovery.
 
 ZIP Password Recovery, despite the lack of the Polish language version, will certainly not cause any problems to anyone. The tool is operated using a built-in wizard that guides you through the process of password cracking step-by-step.
