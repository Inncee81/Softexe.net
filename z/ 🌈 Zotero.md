Zotero allows you to import virtually any type of files: documents in .pdf, photos, audio or video files, and even screenshots of websites. Through the selected extensions Zotero allows you to import documents from the level of the browser directly into the program. Work with the program can be continued independently of the device after creating an account in a library located in the cloud, which can then be synchronized with the program. Zotero automatically indexes the contents of the library, so finding a specific document is not a problem.
 
 Zotero allows you to mark documents using labels and links. It is also possible to edit information about the document and add notes related to it. The Zotero plugin for word processors allows you to insert quotes in one of many available citation styles. The citation styles used in Zotero are formatted in the CSL editor, so you can format a specific citation style. The library and notes created in Zotero can be exported to many formats, including BibLaTeX, BibTeX, Endnote XML, RIS or RDF.
 
 Attention!
 
 Free access to the library in the cloud allows you to store up to 300 MB of data.
