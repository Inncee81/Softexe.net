Using this software, we will check thoroughly whether our computer has any harmful viruses, Trojan horses, rootkits, worms, keyloggers, spy applications or other false components. The advantage of the program is its full compatibility with other anti-virus software (Avast, Kaspersky or Norton Internet Security). In this way, it can be used as a supplement to the basic security program for Windows. 
 
 
 Zemana AntiMalware has several different antivirus engines borrowed from other manufacturers (Kaspersky, Eset, AVG, Bitdefender or Avira). It is effective when detecting viruses and can deal with a heavily infected computer without any problems. There were also additional options that allow you to schedule a scan at a specific time or integrate the application with the Windows Explorer, which will allow you to add additional scanning options to the context menu. 
 
 
 Apart from the traditional scanning method, the software also scans in the cloud and when an unknown threat is detected. During this time, it performs an even more accurate scan of an unknown file, using other scanning engines. In addition, the program also uses advanced malware detection technology that does not check checksums, but oversees the behavior of the appropriate program. 
 
 Attention!
 In order to take full advantage of the program's capabilities, you should activate the free version in its configuration options, which will allow you to test the program for a period of 15 days.
