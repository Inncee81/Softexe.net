> ZenWriter is a rather unusual text editor equipped with a minimal user interface, thanks to which we can focus only on working with a document. The application works in full-screen mode and can be an interesting alternative for commercial tools of this type included in office suites.

The comfort of use can be increased by adapting ZenWriter to your own preferences, choosing a background image, music and font. By default, however, the program is devoid of toolbars characteristic for Microsoft Word, where the window with text is surrounded by many, often unnecessary functions. Here all the necessary options are placed discreetly on the right.
