The program can be used by breeders with any number of animals - from a few individuals to flocks of many thousands of pieces divided into different geographical locations. Zootechnic allows for the collection of various information about each animal, such as: breed, ear tag number, date of birth or arrival to the herd or pedigree of a given art, which is particularly useful to document the origin of cattle entered in the General Ledger kept by PZHiPBM.
 
 The bovine registers may contain health data, measurements or nutritional data. This enables a detailed analysis of the costs of treatment and nutrition as well as determining the impact of the diet on milk yield, weight gains, etc.
