The program is very easy to use, does not require the user to have specialist knowledge and may be an alternative to the popular AdwCleaner. Once launched, it performs a thorough scan of Windows in search of all unnecessary components and then removes them. In addition, ZHPCleaner creates a report on the desktop, containing detailed information about the results of the work.
 
 ZHPCleaner during its operation searches for all files / folders that are garbage, and also performs an accurate scan of the Windows registry and services running in the system. In addition, the tool can be used successfully to remove from the most popular browsers various types of harmful additives (toolbars, adware components, etc.).
