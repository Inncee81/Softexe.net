The program has a simplified but functional user interface, which should not cause problems in the service of even beginners and with limited knowledge about the operation of this type of application. Zipware offers automatic integration with the system at the context menu level and program settings as the default for opening archives in supported formats.
 
 Zipware allows you to unzip ZIP, ZIPX, RAR, ISO, GZIP, TAR archives and many others, by yourself allowing you to compress any files to ZIP, 7-ZIP and self-extracting EXE files. The program has no problem with dividing large files into many smaller archives and securing created files with a password. A welcome option is the ability to send the created archive to the Virustotal website to be scanned online.
