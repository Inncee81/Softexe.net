In addition to the standard functions, Zoom Player FREE has been equipped with a user interface available on the entire screen, which we can operate with only five buttons, such as: up, down, left, right, select. With it at your fingertips we have access to all options, namely, media library, file browser, playlist editor, color settings, equalizer, bookmarks, playback history and many more.
 
 Zoom Player FREE is characterized primarily by simplicity - it makes it possible for users who have no more experience with this type of application to reach for the program. At the same time, more experienced customers will also find many useful options in it.
 
 It's worth adding that Zoom Player FREE allows you to transform any computer into a Home Entertainment Center (HTPC) without the need for specialized hardware or specific operating system requirements. The program is compatible with every version of Windows, both 32 and 64-bit.
