The operation of the program is basically limited to selecting the category of characters that we would like to know. The user has at his disposal a collection of warning signs, prohibitions, order, horizontal, information, for drivers of the tram, as well as additional plates, evacuation signs, occupational health and safety protection and fire protection.
 
 With the help of the application, we have the opportunity to learn the exact circumstances of the use of a given sign, its meaning, occurrence and even trivia. An additional option is a quiz, which is used to check knowledge about selected categories of characters.
